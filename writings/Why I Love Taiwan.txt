##Why I Love Taiwan
The people of Taiwan are friendly, physical, panful, note xenophobic — perhaps the opposite — perhaps *because* they are playful.

Their playfulness is not intelligent. A new flavored tea, any public event is enough. A day may consist of browsing a night market, eating at a favorite local restaurant, going to karaoke; Easily excited, simply satisfied. Selfies, pictures of everything. Shared, of course.

They are social. They rarely do anything alone. Constantly messaging, sharing photos, or physically near. Each contact delightful.

Childish? Immature? Perhaps, but I like it. To be satisfied so easily. To be stable, to be so happy.

Neighborly, helpful They live within their means, not wanting more.
