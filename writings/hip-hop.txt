Thoughts on Hip-Hop:

[todo: Why I love hip-hop music: more social content, less socially-valueless music]

[todo: possible writings: insularity of English language as a medium, insularity of hip-hop (references / community), hip-hop canon]


I’ve stopped reading long ago.

I’ve stopped living long before that.

I’m just “killing time”, and listening to music.

The music I’ve listened to recently fits my recent experience quite well.

First with giving up all hope in society, invoking the stoicism [todo: link to blog post] of Vince Staples Summertime ’06.

“We all gonna die anyway.”

A popular phrase, but when he says it, he means it. He doesn’t care if he dies or if others die. It seems there is no hope in Norf LA. He’s ”on Artesia, parked in my beemer, bumpin’ my own shit” or on 3230 Poppy St (until he gets evicted). He’s not afraid of giving his location to anyone, just as he’s not afraid of death.

[todo: then with finding myself through Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp a Butterfly, especially when the albums gets to “i”]

### some classic rap records
At some point I felt like going back to play some classic rap records, specifically of the 90s, because anything before that sounds like black people being forced to jive over breakbeats. Hip-hop just didn’t quite develop its form. I tried Public Enemy to no avail, so I turned to Nas and Jay-Z.

Jay-Z’s Reasonable Doubt shows a younger Jay, who was never great in any way. At the least, his gangster rap feels real, and he is. He’s a boss, business-oriented, with an organized clan, who already earned his respect through drug trafficking. The album feels as if it should be skipped, except those tracks produced by [todo: get name], such as Dead Presidents II and the next track Feelin’ It. That snare claps hard over lush loops. But maybe it’s the ease of Jay-Z’s flow that is alluring? I don’t think so.

Nas’s Illmatic is on a much higher level of artistry, depicting the state of mind of a person who grew up in Queens, New York.

[todo: quote NY State of Mind]

“NY State of Mind” is more violent and therefore even harder to believe in than Kendrick’s and Vince’s Compton.

[todo: quote AZ]

In AZ’s grand verse on “Life’s a Bitch” goes from “5%er” to “money-orientated” because “life’s a bitch and then you die”. I can imagine little black Islamic spaces in neighborhoods in Queens, but they can’t compete to the things that money enables. I can only relate in the way that I do things I feel is right or good, but eventually must re-orient my actions toward generation wealth because of capitalism. It’s defeating. Out of the infinite things one can do, one must make that thing fall under the scope of generating wealth, just so one survives. That can’t be right, and AZ nails that sense / feeling.

“The World is Yours” perfectly follows-up with an optimistic chorus; a good reminder. Much of the other tracks [besides One Love?], seem to show more violent life — a bunch of types of guns shooting. “Halftime” and “It Ain’t Hard to Tell” show his lyricism.

I checked out other hip-hop classics that I don’t quite remember: Mobb Deep, Ghostface Killah (Ironman and Supreme Clientele). Much of Mobb Deep is just hardcore rap. Quite scary really, given that they’re “real”. At least when The Wu-Tang Clan raps, though it can be “hard”, it’s more for lyricism (hip-hop aesthetics) exploration. Ghostface is bananas, perhaps years ahead of everyone lyrically. Even his first [major] album Ironman sounds modern.

### the good rappers / socially-aware, educational albums:
My brother had Liquid Swords so it holds a special place for me, and GZA is clearly the *good* teacher of the clan, just as Kendrick is the *good* kid. That’s where it begins for me for the educational, socially aware, hip-hop part as opposed to the social realism of Nas and most other rappers that “make it”. Though, the *good* rappers are capable to depict social reality just as well.

I remember Liquid Swords being a “winter” album. One that you had to listen to while reading the lyrics online (or CD booklet?) before RapGenius.com existed. You had to find the references, because you’re a kid and just simply don’t know, and he referenced things in New York, hip-hop, history[?], and elsewhere. It was also a bit hard to comprehend upon listening because at times he use a technique to reveal narrative information backwards. You had to do some homework to get through it. It’s during the winter that people do their homework. He made sure every line mattered (todo: get lyric).  Cold, harsh, straight from a pre-historic cave RZA boom-bap backed it up. Later, Kendrick made sure every line mattered too. [I didn’t listen to Liquid Swords again, yet]

My brother also had many[?] Killer Mike’s albums. I recently listened to R.A.P. Music (that’s my initials!). The entire album is political. I haven’t seen the news in years, but from my Facebook I know that people are quite late into the social reality of black people. Did people think what black people rapped in hip-hop since its inception (1980s?) was a joke? Those things should be known and believed in the first time one listens to a hip-hop album. Or the is the process of injecting reality into media really that slow? Or are most people just unable to understand the communication of hip-hop, and only understand, albeit, very little, through some article in the news or a book written by a more Western-cultured person? Or are people just not able to transform and digest communication to reality?

It seems Killer Mike had it down-pat at least 4 years ago. The first half contains examples of social-poetical problems through narrative or otherwise. In the second half the content flows more smoothly beginning with “Don’t Die” where a church minister gospels about why black people tolerate bullshit from white people, and then Killer Mike encountering a “fake cop”, knowing the difference because his “Dad’s a cop”, and continuing at the wildly hectic pace of a cop chase with El-P’s production supporting it creating a prelude to Run Them Jewels. Killer Mike is clearly another good kid (listen to “Willie Burke Sherwood”), now with a clear intention of pushing socio-political education and development through the medium of hip-hop.

I be an outlaw before I ever behave
I die a free-man before I live like a slave
and nothing changes if they catch me today
fuck the police is still all I gotta say
  - the end of “Don’t Die” by Killer Mike

In that ending, even I felt some relation, of anarchy, for freedom. Living the way that I desire, as opposed to rules governed by economic or social systems. That strive to live in one’s own way resonates well within those words.

[todo: Kendrick’s good kid and Kendricks TPaB]

### ?

All of the music contain experience: growing up (usually in rough places for “real’ hip-hop artists), state of mind, education, social problems, political problems, socio-political development, and love.

Deerhunter
“Carrion”
[chorus:]
“carry on, carry on, I set you free, I set you free, now run along, now run along”

[verse:]
“everywhere I go, I’m reminded, long ago, it’s so long ago, but it won’t leave! Please leave me! Leave me alone. I am alone. Deep in the ground. Looking around. Trying to find my home. Trying to find a home. But I dug to deep! I dug to deep. I cannot see. I cannot see. What’s wrong with me!? What’s wrong with me!? What’s wrong with me. What’s wrong with me.”

Vince Staples
“Lemme Know”
[chorus]  “popping’ babies, don’t keep me waitin’, be my lover, be my lady, other people, drive me crazy, really got me thinkin’ bout’ it (‘bout it).” [verse?] “If there’s one thing that I know, (I know), then I know nothing at all.” [last verse, female] “I’ma let you know, that I got that dough, but if you take a toll, you gonna’ be runnin’ around trippin, you better be certain before you consider fucking me’, because if you hit this shit one, I know you gonna be in love with me.”

“Summertime”
[chorus] “This could be forever baby… [verses] open up your eyes and tell me what you’re thinking’, open up your mind and tell me what you’re seein’…I prolly couldn’t fix it if I knew the reason…Is it love, I would really like to know the meaning…open up your heart, if we don’t love, then we fall apart…”My feelings told me love is real, but feelings known to get you killed, I feel I’m misconstrued, I feel I’m missing you.”


### Other music
In Vijay Iyer and Wadada Leo Smith’s A Cosmic Rhythm with Each Stroke, a quiet storm appears. It can be continued with Miles Davis’s In a Silent Way.

With Joe Hisaishi’s soundtrack for Kukujiro No Natsu, one can imagine Taiwan as a Miyazaki film, transforming the cacophonous trucks into cute little worker bees: a society that fights for survival together, the grit of reality contrasted by the happiness of the people.
