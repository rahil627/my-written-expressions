On the slowest train to Xinzhu (because there are no more trains to Tainan for the night).

Thought about having a political meet-up / presentation of some of my findings of politics, media, and human psychology in cases for Taiwan from my own historical personal experience. Many of the people from communities in Taipei showed up: Pan’s group, that one art group Vinay and I bombarded, and a few others. The presentation turns toward *doing* politics, calling organizations and people, connecting people, trying to persuade people with power; Just trying things because the attendants desire for change. I Iive in a natural part near Tainan, with a close friend, and where many orphans and neighborhood kids now seem to hang out in the environment that we created. So, I’m quite apathetic the entire meet-up, but willing to connect people with information or other people, in a very non-passionate way.

Then, I wonder what I’m doing. Going to Tainan? **Normally, I go to places to meet people, but now, I’m being super conservative, choosing to go to a secluded place like a recluse.** Am I running away from people? For freedom? For leisure time? Because I currently don’t care about people? Is it wrong? Should I be in Taipei or New York? Nah, we’ll see if I can get my mind straight. Gladly, Tainan has much sunlight, and is dry. We’ll see.

Trains, moving, socialization, here we go again.
