The community will begin after I'm all sorted out with a home and a tiny amount of income. In the past I just joined existing communities / areas / cities and not worry about having a proper home, but now I think I'll begin with a good home. It alllllll takes sooo much tiiime.

It really sucks to even think about money, capitalism, or anything like that, but, maybe it's worth getting money quickly first. Billy also recently decided to do more work hours / save some money, and use some to record his music.

Mmmm, as for the community, I think it's similar to the ideals that is inside the minds of many people at 屏東藝文嘍 (PoA) and 能盛行 (NSX). Much of the values and beliefs are in common. This time the environment is just much closer to nature and more natural-living societies, like the many nearby aboriginal tribes. So, as far as a place to live, it's probably not much different from PoA. It's simple-living; and, the fruits are in season and delicious! 😀

I think compared to PoA and NSX, I'm far more political and less anarchic. So I think more of activism tactics, civics, empowerment, and, what tools (tech) can be made to aid those things. Just see local problems and try various solutions, talking to local people. It could be blocking automobiles from entering markets, inspecting and encouraging businesses to waste less plastic, figure out what to do with cheated migrant and aboriginal workers, or just documentaries when I feel more artistic. I'm just a little afraid all of those ideas are more Western. Politics is really complex in Taiwan, as everyone's mind is so different. But, oh well, have to try.

I mostly talk to 蘋 (Apple) and 凱維 (Kaiwei) (the solar-panel tricycle duo) now, who are both from Taibei, and who both used to work at Greenpeace long ago. At the moment Apple is introducing me to a few of her East-side friends here, whom all are quite modern farmers. But I don't see too much activity here. It's a really slowwwwwww place to live.

Anyway, it will all take time. Gladly the weather and fruit here is soooo gooood! 😀
