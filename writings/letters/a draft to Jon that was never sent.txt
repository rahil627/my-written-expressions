ATL, Nice! I thought you were in some more outdoorsy mid-west town with your gal? I might be back in VA to sub my Dad, if my Dad has to go to India. That is, if I make money in time? Not sure if I can make over-dough without teaching English out here.

Mmmm, I dreamed of working from home just yesterday (besides the motel). Parents houses are toooo comfortable, hahaha. I was looking into emergency care things like EMT (the dudes that come outta ambulances) / firefighter (in some states, doubles as medics). It seems you just have to volunteer at a local / in-state stations for experience and take a relatively cheap and fast month long class (for basic; upgrades to white and red mage possible). Apparently they make near minimum wage and work wonky shifts! Perfect.

Well, just an idea from yesterday. On how to get into better into emergency care / disaster relief without medical school. I never would have thought firefighter = ambulance people, disaster relief, red mage.
