Sarah!

This is being written at 4:00AM. You probably shouldn’t read this. Hahahah!

Long time no communication. My bad. I haven’t been using technology to communicate for quite a long time. First no Facebook posting, then even less messaging. NOT that I didn’t think of you at all ever without Facebook! Just busy, you know, with the world nearby.

Anyway, now that I’ve got my computer after living without it for 6 months, I get to talk to who ever I think about it. Such power!

First off, congrats yo! You found yourself a handsome Spanish (El Salvadorian?) “dude”! Hahahah. This was inevitable: I would have bet all the pesos on it.

After a recent soul-crushing heart-break (with a Taiwanese dudett[?]), post-heartbreak talk, two weeks of heart-ache, and now aimless wondering, I effing mean this from the bits of heart that I have left: I wish the best for your relationship. Though, I’m sure you’re way way better than me at social relations, communication, and so on; More in tune with the world; More feeling, less over-thinking; Naturally avoiding communication errors, doing more things together, spending more time together; Better able to adapt to each other, and the world around. Yeahhhhh, no problem for Sarah, I imagine.

Hmmm, otherwise, it’s just always interesting to kind of compare the life of a person who grew up in southeast VA and lived elsewhere, particularly a less developed country with a different culture. Get a bit of that immigration experience that our parents (maybe yours?) experienced, but in reverse, and therefore impossible to compare.

Hmmm, I have no idea what I’d do if I were in VA now. Find a mountain that’s not 4 hours away? Actually go to the beach? Bike around the dismal swamp? Bike around something less dismal. Vote? Get an international driver’s license with a motorcycle stamp! Heck yes. Hopefully you’re still constantly creating new experiences back at home!

Anyway, hope all is well in Sarah’s world. :)
