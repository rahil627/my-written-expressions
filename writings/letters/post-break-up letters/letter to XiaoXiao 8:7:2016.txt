Holy crap, traveling is no fun without talking to people. I don’t know how people can enjoy camping alone. I’m not even sure how I travelled so much before. Maybe I relied on hostels for a social life while traveling. Getting old, getting old.

Anyway, before I left the hostel, Baozi finally decided to talk. As usual he didn’t say anything useful (factual), [he] just told me of his mental structures and shallow philosophy. He did however tell me why I had to sleep outside: it’s because his Dad feels I tore his traditional dreams: for his son to have a good wife and family. We’re not worried about that; We’re worried of the same thing: you.

He also told me about how he enjoys experimenting with people, including me and you: by giving choices, such as which room to sleep in, free nights, or framing questions. I already knew that, but I didn’t know he *enjoyed* it. It’s a bit wicked.

Though our (me and Baozi’s) relationship is somehow still fine, he still seems to say some terrible and/or stupid things, for example: his worldview, cultural stereotypes, or even comparing you to your father. If you continue to stay at the hostel, I hope you can continue to ignore those terrible and/or stupid things, and not let it get to you. You’re smarter than that.

I’m guessing I’ll probably continue thinking about my social history / problems until I begin city life again, upon which my mind will become busy. But perhaps this should be the last letter. Any more might may make me appear pathetic!

I only hope the same thing that my mom hopes in me: that you are happy and healthy.

屁， 跟沒有人聊天的旅遊沒有好玩。我不知道人怎麼可以喜歡自己打帳篷。我連不知道我怎麼以前旅遊了。也許我旅遊者需要宿舍的社會。我老了老了。只有老人有長的關係，哈哈。

哦，對吧。我背包客離開以前，包子總算決定跟我說話（溝通？）。照常他說了沒有用的對話：他的不深的哲學，思想，之類。但是他告訴我為甚麼我需要在外面睡：他的爸爸覺得我破了他的創痛的夢－想要他的兒子有家庭。可惡。我們沒擔心那個東西；我們只擔心一樣的東西：妳。

他也告訴我他喜歡實驗（試驗？）人，連妳跟我。他喜歡給人選擇，那一房間睡，免費的住宿舍，什麼的。我，妳已經知道，可是我不知道他其實*喜歡*，我只是覺得那是他的生氣的反應。覺得一點惡性。

雖然我跟包子的關係好（奇怪？），他還一直說壞的，本的句話。譬如說：他的世界觀，文化的想法，或者他比一比妳的爸爸跟妳。如果你會繼續跟他一起住，我真希望你可以繼續不理他說的東西－跟人去外，聽音樂，之類。別讓他影響妳。妳比那個東西聰明。

從現在到我忙的時間我猜我可能繼續想我的社交的歷史，溝通的問題。沒回答的話，也許這封信是我最後的。寫多我可能會看起來太可憐！ 下次我一定會用中文想出來。翻譯太無聊。

我只希望跟我的媽媽希望一樣：妳健康，開心。
