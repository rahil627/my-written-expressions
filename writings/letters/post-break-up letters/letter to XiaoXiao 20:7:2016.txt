Tell me if you need a Chinese translation, haha.

### some other post-birthday thoughts:
#### clarification of a rule
I wanted to clarify a very simple problem we encountered several times. In the situation where a person is in a relationship, people, including me, try not to affect the relationship for the simple reason that it ruins a relationship, and even further, the relations through the partner. It took me a very long time to think, and it almost requires you to “torture” me, because there is a rule in my mind that I am forbidden to act. I never wanted to ruin your relationship with Baozi, furthermore, I never wanted to ruin your relationship with his family. It makes commitment a very complex decision.

Again, in a similar situation, when I arrived at the hostel, you and Anton seemed close according to Baozi’s gestures. I wasn’t so sure. So again, I don’t react because the simple reason that I don’t want to ruin your relationship with Anton. [To me, ]Anton, Baozi, Baozi’s family are all people. Furthermore, his family and even he has traditional culture. I know what this means because my family has traditional culture too. It does not matter what *I* think of them [your partners]; It only matters what *you* think of them.

I can only react, I can only love, if you show or tell me that you love me first. Otherwise, I (and any moral person) will never do anything to affect the existing relationships. I thought this belief was normal to all cultures, but maybe I was wrong? This is why I am “passive”. If you weren’t in a relationship, then you’d see my active side. But unfortunately, I let too much time pass.

#### “up to you” and “you can choose”
You often say these phrases: “up to you”, “you can choose”. It’s double-edged: [For me,] There is no choice when the other person is in a relationship. So these phrases never quite make sense to me. It’s not up to me. I have no choice. You liked Baozi and like Baozi’s family. You liked Anton. Again, loving you is not *my* choice. It’s *your* choice.

More recently, joining you on your trip to Australia is a “choice”, but I have no reason to go to Australia except for the sole reason to spend time with you. As far as I understand, you are with Anton, therefore, I would be going as a friend. Saying “up to you” and “you can choose” is a strange thing to say here too. Yes, as a friend, it is my choice to go or not go to Austrailia. And yeah, it could be fun to travel with you to Australia, but I just don’t have many other reasons to go. It feels like you are persuading me. Maybe you try to persuade all of your friends to join you on your trips? Most people don’t have time for a three-month Australia trip.

Go for it. Enjoy. You’re younger than me, remember? Haha.

I’m a bit afraid that we travel for different reasons though. I usually like to try to find some kind of direction, work, train of thought, a rough plan. When I “travelled” through Asia, it involved hectically finding and joining social development organizations (teaching in Taiwan, awareness of prostitution in Penang, Malaysia, aiding Burmese refugees on the Thailand-Burmese border, teaching game design in Boroda, India, protesting in Taiwan, “Humans of Taiwan” project, philosophy, etc.). I only happen to live in hostels. I normally don’t care to travel, eat, or even at times talk with many people hostels. But I do often like travelers than most other people ;) . And that was years ago. I care less of travel now than even before. Bali, Thailand, Australia, and other parts of the world are not places for me to have an“adventure” for a short period of time. They are places that I specifically choose because I want to live, learn their language, work, and have long relationships there. Taiwan was my choice. And I will choose where I go next.

#### more criticisms
There’s a bunch more criticisms you have of me (and other people): you don’t believe other people (including me and Baozi) will change, you often don’t trust other people (including me and Baozi), and you generally have a very simple reasoning of how humans socially develop based on childhood experiences. Contrarily, you have all these negative beliefs and it seems that *you* are unwilling to change. You have to believe and trust in people. And you can’t use simple child psychology to reason people’s problems. People are far more complex, adaptable. This kind of reasoning is marginally better than Baozi’s genetic-based reasoning.

### pre-birthday thoughts
#### my mind before coming to the hostel again
Before coming to the hostel again, I sort of expected you to be there, even without using Facebook or communicating.

I kind of put aside / gave up a certain direction I was striving toward in Taipei, and I decided to just put faith entirely on love, specifically, in loving you. I’ve never done that before. I’ve never sacrificed my own path entirely. Normally I balance work and life. At that point [in time] and before, I loved you. Every time I said I loved you, I meant it and I never lied. To me, saying that I love you is more important than any other social contract (marriage, bracelets, gifts). All that matters to me is that you love me.

So when I came back, I “wanted to talk to you”, because I wanted to ask you, how you felt, if you still even still liked me. And then perhaps ask what you wanted to do, for your career / work / art.

You found me repulsive. That’s all I needed to know. I screwed up. No way to reverse time.

I really needed to know, to conclude and to be able to move on. Like quitting a job, or leaving a shared apartment, I have to make sure I leave with everything in order and in mutual understanding. So I *had* to talk to you, Baozi, and Baozi’s family.

Sorry to be so urgent in wanting to talk on “my own time”, but I really needed to know so that I could continue living.

#### on touching
I thought it was quite clear that when you touch me, even playfully, like playfully waking me up, I react emotionally because I have some feelings towards you. It’s okay to playfully touch friends, but if they love or loved you, I think it’s quite different. Whenever you touched me, it brought a crazy amount of emotions (sadness, mostly). So, there was no way for me to play, or “be funny”, or “be less serious”. At the time I still loved you, I loved you so much that you couldn’t possibly know, so it was very difficult for me to pretend to “be funny”. I’m not very good at pretending or hiding emotions. I react truthfully. If I love, I say it. If I’m sad, I’ll cry. I’m not afraid of either one.

#### a broken state of mind
During my recent visit to the hostel you said these phrases: “trust no one”, “nothing matters”. Those are words of someone in a low state. I felt awful, and realized that I really hurt you, to which I replied, “I felt evil” [in Chinese] the next time I saw you. I never ask for forgiveness, I realized I did something terrible.

### two weeks after the hostel
I spent two weeks of rumination and heartache, riding the scooter and camping. A rather lonely way of traveling. It felt terrible at times. I couldn’t communicate with you because you were “busy” with the market in Hualien, so I decided to wait two weeks before using Facebook messenger. I had to talk, so I talked through these letters. It only felt more terrible to know that you couldn’t communicate to me for two months.

Now, I think I feel okay, to be just a friend. Though, when you sent me a picture of you with 貓貓, it brought emotions (not just of love, just a bunch of feelings). So I think it’s best not to go to Australia.

After some messaging on Facebook, I now even feel that our minds differ too much to ever have a very close relationship. You still seem to be some sort of confused artsy child. And I really don’t want that. It requires a lot of time to care for. I need more maturity, more indepedent-mindedness. In the future, I’ll likely have less time to spend on silly conversations. So don’t expect me to be able to talk much. No one has that kind of time. I usually only spend late nights replying to Facebook messages. But if you need to talk about something more serious, then I’ll try to answer.

#### the end?
I believe I will only love you unconditionally as a friend, but even that is becoming difficult over time. Maybe frequent travelers are difficult friends to have. And so, I slowly lift myself and move on.
