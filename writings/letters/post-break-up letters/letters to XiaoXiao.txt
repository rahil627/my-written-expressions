I know you don't particularly enjoy talking about social relationships, or me speaking in English, or my directness, or perhaps parts of my culture, or now, me entirely, but human language (verbal or written) is the the most precise way I know how; art only distorts it. I hope you get to read it.

I know you don't particularly enjoy talking to me now, but human language is the most precise way to communicate. I hope you get to read it.

I thought of / wrote this in English, then rewrote it in Chinese to avoid communication errors. You can try English first, but it's terse, so you may find it quite difficult.

A few thoughts / feelings during my week at the hostel:
#From day 1 to 3:
I asked and said all I wanted to during our chat at McDonalds: I told you how I felt and asked how you felt. Thanks for allotting me that time.

#From day 4 to day 7:
I felt shocked. How can one fuck a traveler after having met for a few days, especially after a past lover says "I thought about you nearly everyday" a day or two before?

Right after that I felt a bit lucky, happy even, that I saw what I saw because three days of crying is way better than a long period of unrequited love.

Soon after that, I only felt worry. Perhaps drinking and sex was a method to cope with stress, which is coincidentally how you began talking with me. I felt thankful that you have Baozi's family to take care of you. I even told Baozi that.

#After day 7:
After reading your past FB messages, I feel that **I wronged first. You were right:** you communicated that you missed me over a long period of time. 'I can't right my wrongs.'

**This is a consistent fault of my personality.** I tend to focus on things away from simple everyday life. I think most people with Western cultured minds do too. It deviates from the normative cultural life of Taiwan, yet I still prefer and choose it. This is why it seems, as you said, I "am in my own world". My mind is often in many worlds (places). I spend long periods of time working on art, philosophy, and social organization. It takes away time from personal relationships. The allocation of time is quite unbalanced.

**I still only worry for any psychological damage I may have inflicted.** If you think I can do anything can be done to lessen the damage, *tell me*; Until then, I return your last wish: **_take care_** 笑笑.

**Don't worry about me.** During my time in Taipei, I experienced the worst time in my life, and I might have changed my way of thinking. An over-simplified summary: from dependent (socio-political) to independent (art, design, technology). **I** think we often suffer from a similar problem: we care for others too much; perhaps here the media is right: it's more emotionally stable to **_care for / love yourself_ before others**. If you find yourself in a situation where money is necessary to get out, don't be afraid to ask [me for money] (though, you should wait until I begin working, and actually have money :) ).

I'm never quite sure what you're thinking because you rarely express your thoughts or feelings (no past art / communication to show?), but as long as you're sure, the world will worry less.

我知道妳現在不太感覺聽我的話，可是人的語言是最清楚的溝通。我希望一天妳有機會讀。

我用英文想出來了。我後來用中文翻譯為避免溝通的錯誤。妳可第一試試讀英文，可是我寫的很簡練。

在最後禮拜，一些思想 ／ 感覺：
＃從第一天到第三天：
我想要問跟說，我在McDonalds已經問了，說了：我告訴了妳我感覺怎麼樣；我也問了妳感覺怎麼樣。 謝謝妳給我的時間。

＃從第四天到七天：
我感覺震驚了。我的小豬的概念改變了。

那以後我覺得一點好運，可能開心我看了妳跟他，因為三天的痛苦比長時間的單戀好多。

那然後我只覺得擔心。我一點怕妳的壓力應付的辦法是喝酒，找男生聊天；那是妳怎麼跟我開始說話。

然後我覺得感謝你有包子的家庭的照顧。那句話我告訴他。

＃從七天後：
我讀了妳的FB短信以後，我覺得**我第一錯了。妳做的對：** 妳溝通了你「想我」很很長的時間。我沒辦法反傷害。

**這是我個性的一貫錯。** 我常集中東西，不是日常生活。我覺得大部分的西方人也有這樣的想法。這跟通常的太晚日常生活不一樣，我還選擇。這是為甚麼，你說我「am in my own world」。我的心裡常常在很多的地方。我喜歡用時間做東西－藝術，哲學，旅遊，社會的組織，城市。這平常吃掉我的關係（尤其愛的關係）的時間。是很不平衡的。我平常想關於我住的社會／城市。我不常想個個人。 我真抱歉。

**我還只擔心你的心裡被我損害**。如果妳覺得我可以減除，*告訴我*。到那時間我會給你的最後希望：**_「take care]_** 笑笑。

**別擔心我。**我在臺北已經經過我生活最不好的時間。我也可能改了我的想法一點。妳不愛了我只是更不好。有的時候*我*覺得我們常常災一樣的問題：我們照顧別的人太多；在這媒體可能是對的：第一人得自己照顧，自己愛。如果妳需要錢擺脫困境，別怕問我（雖然，你應該等我開工作 :) ）。

我從來不一定懂妳因為妳不長表示妳的思想（有沒有以前的藝術還是文章還是志願？沒有的話需要聊天多。），但只要妳自己在把握，那就是okay.

Holy crap, traveling is no fun without talking to people. I don’t know how people can enjoy camping alone. I’m not even sure how I travelled so much before. Maybe I relied on hostels for a social life while traveling. Getting old, getting old.

Anyway, before I left the hostel, Baozi finally decided to talk. As usual he didn’t say anything useful (factual), [he] just told me of his mental structures and shallow philosophy. He did however tell me why I had to sleep outside: it’s because his Dad feels I tore his traditional dreams: for his son to have a good wife and family. We’re not worried about that; We’re worried of the same thing: you.

He also told me about how he enjoys experimenting with people, including me and you: by giving choices, such as which room to sleep in, free nights, or framing questions. I already knew that, but I didn’t know he *enjoyed* it. It’s a bit wicked.

Though our (me and Baozi’s) relationship is somehow still fine, he still seems to say some terrible and/or stupid things, for example: his worldview, cultural stereotypes, or even comparing you to your father. If you continue to stay at the hostel, I hope you can continue to ignore those terrible and/or stupid things, and not let it get to you. You’re smarter than that.

I’m guessing I’ll probably continue thinking about my social history / problems until I begin city life again, upon which my mind will become busy. But perhaps this should be the last letter. Any more might may make me appear pathetic!

I only hope the same thing that my mom hopes in me: that you are happy and healthy.

屁， 跟沒有人聊天的旅遊沒有好玩。我不知道人怎麼可以喜歡自己打帳篷。我連不知道我怎麼以前旅遊了。也許我旅遊者需要宿舍的社會。我老了老了。只有老人有長的關係，哈哈。

哦，對吧。我背包客離開以前，包子總算決定跟我說話（溝通？）。照常他說了沒有用的對話：他的不深的哲學，思想，之類。但是他告訴我為甚麼我需要在外面睡：他的爸爸覺得我破了他的創痛的夢－想要他的兒子有家庭。可惡。我們沒擔心那個東西；我們只擔心一樣的東西：妳。

他也告訴我他喜歡實驗（試驗？）人，連妳跟我。他喜歡給人選擇，那一房間睡，免費的住宿舍，什麼的。我，妳已經知道，可是我不知道他其實*喜歡*，我只是覺得那是他的生氣的反應。覺得一點惡性。

雖然我跟包子的關係好（奇怪？），他還一直說壞的，本的句話。譬如說：他的世界觀，文化的想法，或者他比一比妳的爸爸跟妳。如果你會繼續跟他一起住，我真希望你可以繼續不理他說的東西－跟人去外，聽音樂，之類。別讓他影響妳。妳比那個東西聰明。

從現在到我忙的時間我猜我可能繼續想我的社交的歷史，溝通的問題。沒回答的話，也許這封信是我最後的。寫多我可能會看起來太可憐！ 下次我一定會用中文想出來。翻譯太無聊。

我只希望跟我的媽媽希望一樣：妳健康，開心。
