To 能盛興:

Hrmm...I'm normally a passionate socio-politically-motivated person with infinite ideas to express in manifold ways, yet, instead of re-charging me toward social activism (and organizing) or political art as I had initially expected, the serene atmosphere of 能盛興 harked a strong sense of a traditional home not too distant from the ones I grew up in: innocent, cultural, apolitical. When I'm within such a place, I have no desire to change (/ alter) the place or people, just as one has no desire alter aboriginal cultures or one's own family; they're already good. That feeling extends to 台南. (It opposes the feeling within a modern city.)

Like the Alex who wrote a sincere letter, I too am a bit sorry for not contributing anything ("the borrower's debt"), yet, everyone within seems to love unconditionally, so it doesn't feel too bad, like eating at my aunt and uncles' homes. Anyway, I seem to be in a very selfish / self-directed mood at the moment, desiring to do my own things:

To begin making my own ideal home (/ community), not too different from this realized ideal home, close to nature.

The letters are true: this is a special place. Truly inclusive: a rare value. Admirable. But my heart is set to hearth that brilliant east coast, and only politic in the big city. :)

Congrats,
Rahil
