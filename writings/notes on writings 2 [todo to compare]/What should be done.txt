#Ideal:
Ideally this is what should be done in order of importance:
*work in politics
*work at a NGO
*seek pure knowledge 
*seek new knowledge
*create art

In detail:
*create art - Create new art — contemporary art, explore new mediums and spaces and ways to express one self
*seek knowledge - Find new knowledge — sciences, including social and political, and synthesis of them all
*seek pure knowledge - Find new pure knowledge, universals, math and logic
*NGO - Directly help people. Comparatively lower effect in quantity.
*work in politics - Make large meaningful changes that affect masses of people

Reasoning:
Why politics? It has the greatest effect on people. The world had enough knowledge to go to the moon long ago, yet a great amount of people still live in poverty, and religious wars still exist. There are too many problems that can be solved, and we already have the knowledge to do so.

#Personality factor:
What was mentioned before is ideally what should be done. Not all people are capable of being a great politician or a great mathematician.

#What will likely be done due to my personal traits:
I feel there are more practical skills to be learned at a NGO than a career in politics, especially a beauracratic one. In addition to social skills needed for politicians, one can educate, directly help people using current means (medicine, engineering, language, farming, etc.), resulting in a faster reward cycle, a more empirical lifestyle, and more pleasure.

As a person who lives an extremely empirical, social life, I would likely end up in the art and NGO routes, a life of experience. I am (as of now) too impatient for large plans. And so, that is likely what I will do.

With that conclusion, apparently, I am a hedon, and can only hope to become a saint, not a hero.
