post to Viranch:

This became quite lengthy. I guess I'm in a writing mood at my Maammy's house. Uh, obligatory disclaimer: this is just my experience, and it's up to you to extract whatever you can from it. And so it begins from Singapore...

Singapore:
After Taiwan, I arrived here. Hostels are rather expensive, and I felt I could get the same or better experience from Malaysia a fraction of the price, so I took a bus to Kuala Lumpur. I think travelers said the buses were faster and more comfortable than trains in Malaysia. I personally didn't care for Singapore much, so I skipped it. It does have ethnic neighborhoods: a chinatown, an Indian town, an arab town. I've met people who had a blast in Singpore.

Malaysia:
My intent here was to make a short film which limited me to places with good facilities, so I wasn't able to explore Malaysia as I kinda wanted to. For the west coast, I recommend Penang and Melecca (I haven't been, but like Penang it was colonized by Europe, which creates a pleasant old city area).
If I were to explore, I'd spend some time on the east coast, or just skip Malaysia and go to Borneo. Borneo seems like a natural paradise.

Kuala Lumpur:
It was interesting to me because it mixed rich development yet had undeveloped areas. A city still in construction. But I guess if you've seen India, you've felt that. The hostels are located in the center and can be really cheap. There's a Chinatown, and Indian area, and the normal city sprawl. The public transportation is similarly under construction and pretty bad. Temple hopping and seeing some nice local feeling neighborhoods can be done. If you're somehow in the mood for some local contemporary performances, check out The Warehouse. There's a nice group of artsy kids from nearby universities doing their thing.

I recommend skipping it, or just spend a day or two as a stop over.

Penang:
I love this place. It's like the San Francisco of Malaysia: relaxed life, an awesome old street with past generation Chinese people crafting stuff, cafes, food, and an extremely well designed hostel: Roomates Penang. One of the best hostel experiences I've had. Except the fact that I had gastroenteritis.

Thailand:
My train went straight from Penang to Bangkok.
I avoided the tourist beaches. I don't relax much. I almost chose dive school in Ko Tao to get a scuba licence. It's cheap, but research can be done to find quality schools. It was also enticing because scuba licenses don't expire. A few travelers I talked to saw whale sharks there. And to me, going underwater is the equivalent of going to outer space; It's unimaginable.

Bangkok:
Another hostel recommendation: Cozy Bangkok. Located near the train station, which also has a metro stop. It's located inside a neighborhood, which is my goal when I try to find hostels. I love it when I go outside and see families and kids running around. Great location, facilities, staff, people. It's all good, and surprisingly in the middle of Bangkok.
Bangkok is interesting. More than just a sleazy city. It feels like an SE Asia's New York. Near the hostel is a University which gives a relaxed school feel. Also nearby is the largest Chinatown fathomable. Red light districts are not far. Streets full of auto-mechanics are close.

Around Bangkok:
I recommend a day trip to Ayyuthaya (or Sukothai). I love biking, and biking around an ancient civilization is much cooler! It's only a day trip from Bangkok.
If I were to go back, I'd check out a nearby town which had a less touristy floating market and train market.

Mae Sot:
I took a bus to the Myanmar border town of Mae Sot. It's a small town with migrant workers and volunteer organizations for nearby Burmese refugee camps. I took a day trip into Myanmar by simply walking over, and the change is huge. It's like going from a pleasant Thai town to a very poor Indian city.
Mae Sot was a compromise. I actually wanted go to Myanmar, but felt that if I had went, I'd have to ship my electronics home and do some real backpacking to avoid paying government taxed hostels, and spend a longer time there, to really get lost.
Not much reason to go except to hop the border, which can also be done easily a little northwest of Chiang Mai.
I took another bus to Chiang Mai.

Chiang Mai:
Another cool hostel depending on your taste: Bunchun. It's also located outside the main city square. It's run by a very eclectic transexual dude. The travelers are hipster-oriented. I can get down with hipsters, but it's not for everybody. The host is amazingly nice, and often takes everyone out to eat or to a party at night.
I didn't care for Chiang Mai. My only reason to come here was to rent a bike to explore northwest Thailand. Still, Chiang Mai has a pretty cool art scene, away from the tourist square.

Mae Hong Son motorcycle loop:
It's a kinda popular bike ride thanks to good road conditions, pleasant weather, and rural scenery. I'd recommend Ban Rak Thai, Ban Ruam Thai, and Mae Hong Son. I spent nearly two weeks, all on a 110cc Honda scooter. [see Motorycle section somewhere below]
Laos:

This was a compromise for not being able to go to Myanmar. At this point I wanted to get as far from touristy SE Asia as I could. I wanted to get away from development. I wanted to stay in indigenous people's villages. It was my last leg before going to India.
I spent a day a more in rocky bus rides to go from Chiang Mai to Phongsali, supposedly the best place to see a variety tribal peoples. Then downriver via slow boat to Muang Khua, Muang Ngoi, Nong Khiaw, Luang Prabang. The scenery is similar to Northwest Thailand, and the people are as friendly as Thai, just much slower. Intelligence goes down. It's rural. I really enjoyed hunting birds with dangerous old rifles and fishing in a village near Muang Ngoi. It's basically a hippie settlement in Laos.

I don't think I'd recommend going to Northern Laos. It was just something specific I wanted to do. I just really wanted to see what an undeveloped area was. Northern Laos isn't much different than a farm just outside of Baroda. It's just one big farm.

Taiwan:
Not SE Asia, and you're probably not going there, but it was the first place I went to, and it holds my most memorable moments. It is my favorite country because the people there are amazingly well-rounded, and I spent a lot of time with them. I absolutely loved every day there. My first hostel in Tiapei, the work exchange, and travelling around the country.

Taiwan works out really well compared to SE Asia because it isn't touristy. People have a reason other than travel to be there. It's easier to get along with local people. People speak English fairly well. Or maybe it was just my perspective? Other travelers say the same though.

Hostel info:
I used hostelbookers and hostelworld for more popular places. I never had to reserve a hostel, even during travelling season. Great hostels can make a huge difference. Having a helpful and knowledgable owner, meeting interesting people, integrating with local people, feeling safe with valuables in a locker. Hostels are an experience of their own. I've had really memorable times in them.

Anti-malarials:
I took one before going to North Thailand, and I don't recommend it. I don't think it's worth, in side effects and cost, taking any anti-malarial for long-term travelling.
I started taking Doxycycline once I knew I was going to bike through northwest Thailand. The medicine had few side effects and was noted as a helpful general antibiotic. It was causing indigestion and heartburn by the time I got to India. It was also screwing up my taste.

My family (my Dad, Don Kaka, Nalini Khaki, and more) take Choloquine, and they say that they never had problems with it. It didn't make sense to take that medicine either as the mosquitos in India are resistant to it.
I think it's best to just avoid mosquitos with long sleeves and sprays. Take the chance. Malaria is curable anyway.

Motorcycle:
I'd just recommend riding a bike anywhere in SE Asia, where road conditions are somewhat decent. Motorcycles are the best form of transportation due to freedom. Avoid bus and train schedules, swerve into random villages, few things feel better than being on a motorcycle. If you can, buy a bike, make an overland trip, and sell it.
Volunteering and Work Exchange:
I high recommend this too. Travelling too fast is detrimental to social life, unless you're able to Skype with friends at home frequently. Living in one place, developing relationships. It's just good.

Couchsurfing:
I couchsurfed a few times in Taiwan and loved it. I usually don't want to plan a trip and just wander about. Living through someone else is one the laziest and so favorite ways to travel. It just requires some time ahead to communicate and set dates. If you have the time to plan, I highly recommend it.

Air Travel:
I used a combination of Kayak and Skyscanner. Skyscanner will find some funky cheap domestic flights that Kayak will miss. There's a flight from KL or Singapore to Philippines for like $20. Air Asia is sweet too. Often it only required a few days to two weeks in advance to book for a good rate.

That's all I got! I'm probably missing a lot more, but I'm sure you'll figure it out.
