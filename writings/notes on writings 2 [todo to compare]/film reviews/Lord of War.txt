The film teeters between a full movie, complete with a family emotional tie in, comedy, a beginning and end, and a full black comedy, but is successful in neither one of them.

If the film had better emotional impact and funnier style of comedy, the movie could have been compared to the superior Thank You for Smoking.

If the film was completely black comedy and a bit smarter, like a Coen Brother film, I would have been extremely interested to see it. =)

Silly fascist leaders, africans with golden AK-47s, Nick Cage, it really does sound good on paper. I really do wish it ventured into a ridiculous comedy.

It was also interesting to see the amount of tanks and weapons. I wondered how they produced those tank scenes.
