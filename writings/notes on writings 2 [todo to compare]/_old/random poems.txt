Two random poems written while working at Village Motel.

poem one:
While the [idyllic?] world watches itself in stupor,
the artists and children
work maniacal[?], toward the unknown [unknown destinies?].

In a city filled with unique individuals,
who's to notice?
In a suburb filled with the unambitious,
who's to care?

Die quietly, unknown.
Live through the work.

poem two:
Waiting for the commercial to be over.
Waiting for the climax of the show.
Waiting for the food to be ready.
Waiting for the weekend.
Waiting for that promotion.
Waiting for the right one to come.

Anticipating the next movie.
Anticipating the next get together.

Always waiting and anticipating.
[When will they forget their own path?]

A thought working at the motel the day after a hurricane
Remove the electricity from the suburban middle-class couch taters for a day, and watch them suffer. Itching for an air conditioned room with a TV and remote, they flock to my motel.

They then discover the nearby Hardeez has a limited menu. Their frustration continues.

How could humans induce such suffering?

What are they supposed to do, without a TV to guide them through their night?


x. I should negotiate a deal with the power plant to extend the blackout.
