My personality likes to explore and try new things. This trait pervades my eating habits. I like to try new foods. This I believe is good because different foods have different nutrients and composition. So my eating habits are a beneficiary of my personality.

Today's diet:

breakfast:
2% milk
some Special K (only because my family had extra!)
some Milk and Honey granola, Rick Bayless's Mexican Mix flavor, contains roasted pumpkin seeds, peanuts, raisins, and cacao

two egg omelette
some leftover chow mein
some leftover taro cake

dinner:
an apricot
some premade organic potato and leek soup
a piece of bread with dark chocolate peanut butter

snack:
some fruit and nut mixes
keemun black tea with a little milk and honey

and lots of water throughout
