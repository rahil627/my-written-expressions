a long dream of performing a rap event at a Babycastles venue:
[It] started with Andre 3000's voice advising me, then K-dot going off with lyrically dense "Backstreet Freestyle"-like bars, except with nerdy content. In between / before each of them [the raps], I ask my philosophical questions of society: of what I'm supposed to do with my experience; Compare societies? Social change? Urban change? Educational change? American ideologies, Taiwan, etc. Then take a break. Then begin with "I Know There's an Answer" cover. Then begin talking / performing as myself, because no one before me covers the material I desire.

[I] Thought about going to Jiufen, but just moved too slow. [I] Barely was able to get to NTU before night [time]. [I] slept for perhaps 10 hours, on and off. Should sleep at the train station again! [It's] really warm, cozy, and also close to [a place with a] shower. [I'm] so lethargic, even after sleeping in an air-conditioned, de-humidified enclosed space.

It was naive to think an institution could ever be as diverse as a hostel, Babycastles, or a public space with good ideals. I knew that and tried to create a space in Taipei [in the past] because the spaces in Taipei were limiting in their diversity, time availability, life supplies. Again, I must try to organize a space again. I know that. It's just the funky weather, my economic situation, and my past impatience. Now that I am patient, directed, with free will, nothing can stop me.

It was naive to think that anything [?] of NY would be diverse, especially in a single-cultured country. Yet, diversity is seemingly relative. I [?] the street vendors, hostel owners, aboriginals, towns were all diverse. One must *look* into it like Chris Marker did Japan. *It's there.* *I just have to extract the goodness from it.* There's greatness in all minds, no matter the intellectual rigor, habituated customs, and so on. It's up to my perspective to appreciate it -- what they communicate. *It's all up to me.* Like the good in [roommates?].
