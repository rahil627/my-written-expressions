the classic argument

why mac?
-top tier and innovative build quailty - keyboard, touchpad, lcd, subtle features such as magnetic and extendable power cord
-having one product allows apple to continually support and update that product, resulting in a stable product which can further be updated to add new features. Non-apple companies release a new product using new technology which can cause large redesigns, abandoning all of the work they did for their last product
--having one product further allows the company to create simple customer support options (the knowledge that an apple tech guy needs is smaller, part replacements are avaiable, apple stores are able to handle everything with ease)
-the only offset is that it can take time for apple to adopt a new technology. Non-apple products will have new technology at the expense of quality and stability (hardware and software)
-I'd personally choose quality and stability over raw power.
