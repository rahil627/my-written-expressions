Ikiru
It's been a few weeks since I've seen a movie. I forgot movies are what keep my perspective in check. They remind me of what is important. They help me forget the unimportant. In this respect, Ikiru delivers.

It plays like an old American classic. Like Scrooge or ..?, it has a simple moral that clear from the beginning. But Ikiru excels due to a greater script, cinematography, and realistic characters/personalities.

It may have affected me more because I too have a similar hard-working, genetically asian personality. I've even recently started a job in which I work too hard, not pursuing my aspirations.


another?
I watch films because I love art, but along with art comes other feelings. One of the resulting feelings is to keep my life in check. To remind me what's important in life, and that the past few days of work are meaningless. I need to do more, achieve more.

I hadn't seen a movie for a few weeks before watching Ikiru, and I'm glad I chose that. I was going to watch Fish Tank, but netflix instant streaming was only able to buffer 10 minutes of HD, meaning it would have to continually load the movie while watching it, causing my movie to be choppy.

Ikiru is a classic. It feels like watching an American fable, like Christmas---, except with a superior script, cinematography, and acting.
