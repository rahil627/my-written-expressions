The Wicker Man
The 1973 version, not the Nick Cage one seen in many youtube parodies of his bad acting.

I saw this at Pratt Institute as part of the Pratt Film Society, and I plan to see it again. Again because I had trouble hearing (I almost always keep subtitles on) and I likely saw the shorter version. Hopefully Iíll update this review then, but for now Iíll keep it short, really short.

The only film that I can draw a comparison to The Wicker Man is Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (1971), in that it is strange, yet enthralling. Itís easy to imagine this becoming a cult film. It was entertaining to watch alone and I bet even more so with friends. The entire film is just so entirely unique. As strange as it is, I feel itís easy to recommend. Iíll leave it at that.
