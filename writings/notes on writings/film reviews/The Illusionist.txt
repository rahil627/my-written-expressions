The Illusionist
a sadder Miyazaki
more detailed than 90s Disney
reminds you quickly animated films can evoke emotions
very little dialogue, making it universally understood
nothing is answered or given, you just have to imagine what the characters are thinking
many other people working in the performing arts are losing it (drunk or suicide), which is horrifying alone, but fitting here
the overall film may not be realistic, but the character's feelings, the relationship are
the sound is notable. I luckily watched it with a good sound system, and the work done by the FX crew and score are amazing. Each footstep on the hardwood floor. The muffled noise of other tenants. The music.
the entire film has the same somber mood, yet contains whimsical characters throughout. This resulted me either smiling, extremely focused, or laughing out loud.
Animated films move so fast that there wasn't a moment I thought about anything else. I was focused on the movie the entire time. I was transported for a moment. It's this feeling that keeps me coming back.
What a lovely film to be made, by so few people too.
I'll definitely watch Hulot as per Ebert's recommendation.
