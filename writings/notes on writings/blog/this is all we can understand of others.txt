This is all we can understand of others

To experience another's life, in addition to the economic and social influences, the latter impossible to experience, the former, difficult, there is the difference of space and time. To simple be with another person in their everyday life, is to be effected by the same urban and social influences of everyday life. This is something that can be experienced. Live through the shift of a subway repairman, a farmer, an office worker, an at-home technical support worker, a housewife, a maid, a baker, and one will, in addition to appreciate people more, understand the social and material forces at work. **This is all we can understand.**

Then, to gain an understanding of several people, one must alternate between living the lives of others -- their work and their social relations. The greater the amount and diversity of lives experienced, the better on's perception of social reality is. **This is a method of understanding**, but it is temporary, because memory is.

Then, retaining the memory of the experiences with people, one must create something that would be beneficial to the greatest amount and diversity of people,\.

Then, one should repeat the process [of experiencing and creating]. **This is the way of building a more inclusive society and environment**.
