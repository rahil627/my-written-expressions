I saw this once, perhaps during my Netflix DVD run during my late high school / early college years. I just remember it not being as effective to me as Totoro[T], or, much later, [The Wind Rises][tWR] and [Castle in the Sky][CitS].

developed, tourism, hot (spring) baths for capitalists
  - [This is true. That’s what it is. That’s what much tourism is about in Taiwan. Going to some rural town for a hot spring. I’ve never stayed at a hot spring hotel, but, I have used their shared hot spring bath before (just because I wanted a hot bath during travel!).]
  - [When one takes the train around Taiwan, one can clearly see hot spring resort towns. Their income seems to solely be from people who get away from the city to simply stay in a hot spring hotel.]

soot as lowest rung of workers
  - coal workers, communistic / solidarity feel in their enthusiasm toward the heroine

oil (/fat) house (/room) [the name of the bathhouse]

countryside beyond yonder [a still image in the film]
  - [itself, ]full of pigs (capitalists)
    - lost their control, gluttony

Wild Things[Where the Wild Things Are?]-like creatures. capitalist consumerism, especially fat ducks [chicks?] with eyes wide-open — eyes wide-open as their mind is prioritizes sight above thinking. Actually, all of the creatures have their eyes wide-open
  - [here, it reminded me of WALL-E]

must suck up to the rich (stinky, filthy) [must please the rich people]

witch as capitalist [land]owner

the bathhouse as a metaphor for capitalist industry

literally cleaning the shit of customers
  - becomes a white dragon?
    - [ah right, that was before knowing that Hake was a guardian spirit; I think. Haku could have become a giant, filthy, capitalist too, as he has similarly great power / knowledge.]
  - even literally includes the trash / waste eaten(?) by the customer
    - [starting with a bike, perhaps a metaphor of the luxury of personal transportation, and then what seemed like a junkyard. That’s the waste of up keeping a wealthy individual.]

## thoughts during second viewing of beginning, that may have re-occured

Hmmm, moving as a kid. Perhaps the entire film was a metaphor for that too, like Makoto’s film. All of Miyazaki’s films involve moving, living in another place, another fantastic world, acclimatization. Does she just have to do the *work* to get back home? Where is her home anyway, now that she moved.

Fantastic things are such a short distance away: in the case of Japan, just a highway exit away. Houses for guardian spirits, attention drifts toward historical cultural objects. Travel can do that.

Again, as in most Ghibli films, the family moves to a rural location, where shopping is done in the next town.

An Audi is chosen for the car. Her parents have an at least middle class appearance, nothing too showy: jewelry, mid-weight. Certainly not fat, well, not American-fat.

In the old train station, a colorful stained glass reminds me of the one from Howl’s Moving Castle. It has the primary colors, in reality (RYB) and digital (RGB).

Perhaps the old rocky statues (of guardians?) exist in reality.

Perhaps the abandoned amusements park is a metaphor for abandoned gold mines in Jiufen…And now they’ve become tourist spots for the history, but in reality, much of the tourism is for the food. At least, in simple morals of the film.

Oh yeah, that dog meat restaurant. Sometimes it feels as if Miyazaki is criticizing Taiwan, for loving food, but surely he means to direct it toward humanity, or, at least, of Japan. After all, it’s him, a Japanese tourist taking a peek at Taiwan.

“I’ve got credit cards and cash.” Perhaps the beginning of capitalist behavior, contrastingly different from Chihiro, who wants to go home, and perhaps eat simply, at home.

An old thought: In animation, like most mediums, one has infinite time to design exactly one’s intentions and expressions. Here, every scene is chosen carefully, adding more symbolized meanings, more lessons, more of everything.

And, as we gather experience, ideas, metaphors for reality, we place them onto these symbols, to make meaning, as an adult, an experienced person.

Perhaps the factory is representative of Jiufen’s past gold mine, in addition to the current hot spring resort. Both only appeal to capitalists. Yet, here, it gives an image of a coal factory, or an oil factory, for electric power.

A pithy waterfall behind a gargantuan artificial building.

The straight hair of Haku reminds me of the male character from Voices from a Distant Star.

During the day, Taiwan is quite pleasant. People working, or at home. It’s at night when the night markets appear, just as the place comes alive in the film.

Water appears to block Chihiro from the train station. In Jiufen, there used to be a train that went there, when the town was more populous. I think. I remember taking bus to get there. The closest train station was in a nearby town: Ruifang.

Looking at the old train station at a distance, with water, reminds me of looking at one of Hong Kong’s islands, with a double-decker ferry going by. Also, just as in the film’s image, Taiwan’s urban areas center around the train station, lighting up urban life.

In Japan, these double-decker ferries exist too, taking main island residents to other islands. Usually, for tourism. So, it kind of doubles for Japan’s (capitalist) tourism too.

I’m not too familiar with Japanese culture to understand the creatures and people chosen to be the capitalist customers. Perhaps the capitalists, aristocrats from history? That nice, fat, white slug-like creature. The dumb ducks like sheep: mindless. A witch with a pocadot dress? 

[meaning of disappearance over time, unless one eats in the world? Have to eat capital to be in capitalism?]

[meaning of initially unable to stand up?]

They run through vats of alcohol, then a room full of hanging meat, a freezer, and finally a pig pen.

Yeah, the creatures are just silly, stupid-looking. The dumb-duck has an taro leaf as a hat! Other characters have buckets on their heads. Maybe stupid creatures from the cultural past?

“If you stay here, they’ll find you.” You can’t be human in a capitalist society. You have to be them, a stupid duck.

“You have no choice, if you want to survive here…and save your parents too.” The capitalism ultimatum.

Haku shows a path out of capitalism:

“Ask him [Kamaji] for work. If he refuses, keep asking.” To work.

“If you don’t work, Yubaba will turn you into an animal.” Ah, so that’s what happened. The capitalists stopped working, and are now all animals. Work being some vague traditional thing, that pedestals the workers at hot spring, and the elder sister witch. Likewise, if you don’t work in reality, you are seen as an animal.

“She’ll try to trick you into leaving, but keep asking for work.” Hmmm, don’t quite remember capitalist rulers tricking people into leaving.

“The work’s hard, but it will protect you.” The capital will protect the survival of a human.

“Then even Yubaba can’t harm you.” With capital, even a capitalist ruler can’t harm you, as you have the means to survive.

Even the worker frogs have wide eyes. Perhaps also in it for the capital.

[And, I think that’s where I took a break during the first view.]

Hmmm. In a documentary about Studio Ghibli, it was shown that the film was incepted when the director of Evangelion was talking to Miyazaki (after he had come from a stay in a cabin in nature) about celebrating a Japanese culture coming-of-age holiday for his daughter. Perhaps the film can be seen as a moral guide for those coming-of-age, to prep them from capitalism.

Perhaps the way she slowly goes down the stairs shows how much East Asian children lack outdoor, physical experience. Or, the lack of desire to survive in capitalism.

When she jumps down the stairs, the camera is static, giving an exploration game feel (Prince of Persia, Dragon’s Lair), focusing on the animation of the character.

Oh right, Kamaji is mixing herbs for the baths, with a mortar and pestle like tool.

Her entrance into capitalism looks really out of place, side-stepping a lump of coal toward the boiler, but perhaps, it’s the most important scene, as it shows Chihiro, the human, the most human, the only human (? I guess there’s the elder witch), in the capitalistic world behaving like a capitalist. The result is awkward. Here, I’m reminded of Il Posto. Coming-of-age. Entering the working-world. Acting inhuman.

“If they don’t work, their spell will be broken.” Another way to get out of capitalism: don’t work. It contradicts Haku.

Everything for Kamaji is organized for a life of working: tea, toothbrush, cigarettes, a giant pantry full of herbs, all within one of his arm’s reach.

The sootballs get colored stars. Perhaps too symbolic. Of reward? Simple psychological conditioning?

Ahhh, the contract, the social contract, how humans agree upon *work*.

Kamaji says good luck like any good-hearted old capitalist worker.
