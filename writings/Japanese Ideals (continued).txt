In the top Japanese animated films, there is an ideal of beginning in nature, or living in a rural area, such that of one near a mountain and river.

Before, the rural area reminded me of the neighborhood I grew up in: [College Park][CP]. Later, it reminded me of much of Taiwan, as Taiwan seems to be what Japan used to.

Nearly all of my favorite films by the top directors — Ghibli’s Takahata’s [Only Yesterday][OY] and Miyazaki’s [My Neighbor Totoro][MNT], Hosoda’s [Wolf Children][WC], Keichii’s [Colorful][C], and Shinkai’s [Voices From a Distant Star][VfaDS], [todo: can add Koreeda’s Still Walking, ?’s Letter to Momo] all begin in such an idyllic and ideal place: a rustic single home, with a large garden or farms or nature.

Did we all grow up in the same place? Or is it a desire for one’s childhood place: a nostalgia; and during the process of desiring or nostaligizing, we fantasize an ideal?

For the sake of these directors, each of their lives [lifestyles] likely greatly differ from the ideal they depict [in their films]. These are, after all, people who work within a company of people that live in some modern Japanese city. [Koreeda mentioned that he often ate frozen meals, not the freshly-cut radish depicted.]

Miyazaki works like a Japanese android with capitalist ethic in a bland office building[1][anchor]. The employees draw animation frames like office-slaves, just as the design-illustrators of airplanes did in The Wind Rises. There’s some green on the roof, around his atelier, and surely around his mountain cabin (the different places and dwellings similar to the places beyond the magical door and states of Howl’s Moving Castle), but, otherwise, his body is slaving away 8 hours per day in a room with window blinds all closed, without noise, isolated from life. An epitome of Japanese life.

Yet, the Japanese life is opposite of a nature-loving one. In fact, the people who made the films (all employees) are likely living against the lifestyles depicted in the films: they live in a plastic, digital world. For the employees that work within the office, it’s nearly necessary (as the offices are in cities, not nature). Further, Japan only has two natural parts, the southern-most islands and the north part of the northern-most island; The rest is highly-developed, including the rural areas[2], which contain intensely-mechanized farming.

That kind of farming is not like the manually-farmed areas in Only Yesterday (though, Takahata had good reasoning) and Wolf Children. The other three films contain households in rural areas, but the main characters are not farmers. [todo: don’t remember Totoro, but I think it was just a garden, not a farm]

For most of the films, the magic begins as the characters explore just a little away from their abodes toward nature, or at least a rural area. [There’s a bit of truth to that][nature and reality.] Experiences happen, memories are created, past memories are revoked, awareness of nature arises, new interests are found and explored, explorations begin. It cures melancholy, depression, loneliness, loss. It allows the mind to breathe.

The directors have memories of the awe of experiences in nature (or rural): the interest of old trains, swimming in a river, chasing animals, making a dwelling, collecting natural objects, increased awareness of reality, and general rural life.

They re-created their memories, mixing it with desired ideals via animated films. They spent their lives idealizing something they haven’t actualized. **They are hypocrites** (save Takahata, who’s always had higher intentions).

[todo: to continue! Perhaps necessarily so, in the modern world, as it troublesome to go backward in society’s progress, and be a simple farmer.]
