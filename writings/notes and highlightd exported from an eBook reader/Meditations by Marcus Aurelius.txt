Highlights and Notes of Meditations by Marcus Aurelius
Book 1:

To do my own work, mind my own business, and have no time for slanderers.

To practice philosophy, and to study with Baccheius, and then with Tandasis and Marcianus. To write dialogues as a student. To choose the Greek lifestyle—the camp-bed and the cloak.
  - No sports, focus on philosophy! Also, writing dialogues seems like a good method of learning. And, having a camp bed, to allow the body to live simply, is great. The cloak, I'm guessing refers to war, which in the context of time, is also a great decision, and really must have shaped their body, attunning them to reality. Of this last bit, I feel related to my desire for nomadism, to avoid sedentarism.

Not to be sidetracked by my interest in rhetoric.
  - *** Avoid abstract philosophy, stick to reality, action, practical philosophy. Practice, not academic philosophy
 
Independence and unvarying reliability
  - ***

pay attention to nothing, no matter how fleetingly, except the logos
  - *****

And for introducing me to Epictetus’s lectures—and loaning me his own copy.
  - Mmm, Epictetus book of lectures, maybe includes the enchiridion!

What it means to live as nature requires
  - and later again, That I was shown clearly and often what it would be like to live as nature requires
  -  Second time mentioned this. I guess it's just stoicism from earlier stoics.

 the principles we ought to live by.
  - Should humans have principles?***** It seems to me Marcus took a set of principles, ethics, to live by, but is it possible that such a set could be successful? Doesn't life require different sets for different goals? To experience different states of minds. I don't think any stoic would make a good artist, or many other personalities. They are a narrow set of personalities made for the Senate.

His ability to get along with everyone
 - *** Reminds me of Ivar. Getting along with everyone is different from being everyone, or another. There is still a class difference. One can get along with a slave, but to do nothing about the fact slavery exists is wrong.

To recognize the malice, cunning, and hypocrisy that power produces,
  - Sneaky power tricks of upper classes

the peculiar ruthlessness often shown by people from “good families.”
  - Mmm, corrupted upper class

Not to be constantly telling people (or writing them) that I’m too busy, unless I really am.
  - ***** very important. I think Taiwan's culture is good with it. But with such small deeds, could one ever specialize knowledge? And change society through discovery or technology?

Similarly, not to be always ducking my responsibilities to the people around me because of “pressing business.”
  - ***** Responsibilities to the people around. Sounds like a spatial thing there. But yes, perhaps being responsible is another stoic standard. But, did he ever think of why he was responsible for them? Does he not think of what other groups of people or societies are responsible of? Is he simply a completely digiligeny socially normal person?

conceived of a society of equal laws, governed by equality of status and of speech, and of rulers who respect the liberty of their subjects above all else.
  - ***** this is beautifully simple

Doing your job without whining.
  - Slave-like thought, if the job I'd actually harmful to society, or useless

his advance planning (well in advance) 
  - ***** as opposed to desiring socio-political change now, slow change for the slaves

That I wasn’t more talented in rhetoric or poetry, or other areas. If I’d felt that I was making better progress I might never have given them up.
  - *****Neither a politician or an artist

That whenever I felt like helping someone who was short of money, or otherwise in need, I never had to be told that I had no resources to do it with. And that I was never put in that position myself—of having to take something from someone else.
  - Fortunate in capital too, no experience of being excluded or poor

That when I became interested in philosophy I didn’t fall into the hands of charlatans, and didn’t get bogged down in writing treatises, or become absorbed by logic-chopping, or preoccupied with physics.
 - Not science, not philosophy treatise, not minute logic. Just the practical bits that can be applied to life: notably, ethics.
