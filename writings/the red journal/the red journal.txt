life begins, again...

i’m in-inspired, unable to live, disabled.

how does one live without money, again?

should my passion to live drive me, again?

what if I don’t have that passion anymore?

back to work, money, art?

**at this later age, i know what i want, what i want to do, how to live.**

my mind is organized to live in that way. It’s instrumental—a goal—yet, to live that way itself is ever-changing, not instrumental.

become *full-of-life* again.
