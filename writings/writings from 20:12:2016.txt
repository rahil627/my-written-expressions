21/12/2016 [blogged as “starting over”]
The music makes me feel alive, but it’s a fake sensation. How long I lived with music during my suburban life. Without it, I am dead, in need of sensation, people, nature, love.

a thought during my readings today, and a huge extension of that thought:
Critical Theory and Taoism are opposites, yet, I am attracted to both. The search for problems in society and making it aware for social change, and, living in harmony with one’s self and harmoniously with people and nature. The first is political, the second is apolitical. Then, doesn’t that make Taoism ignorant, apathetic, and therefore unawaringly conservative — permitting the conservation of the existing cultures of people? Critical theory desires to change culture. **I want to change culture, yet I want to be in one.**

Should I begin again, alone? Make a few close friends? Work one’s way from individual to society?

Should I go into the wild and reside there? Create my own society?

Were all those civil community ideas useless? Because their values will never be as extreme as mine, no matter how much I politic with them?

I have no desire to help, work, live, with people whom I don’t value. I used to value Taiwanese people. What happened?

I shall find my own place in nature. With kids. With a girl. And we will play all night. And it will be beautiful.

Fuck the world.

highlights from Aristotle by A. E. Taylor

bio:
“Possibly Aristotle thought himself injured when the school passed him over and elected Xenocrates of Chalcedon as its new president. At any rate, though he appears never to have wholly severed his connection with the Academy, **in 335 he opened a rival institution in the Lyceum, or gymnasium attached to the temple of Apollo Lyceus, to which he was followed by some of the most distinguished members of the Academy. From the fact that his instruction was given in the peripatos or covered portico of the gymnasium the school has derived its name of Peripatetic. For the next twelve years he was occupied in the organisation of the school as an abode for the prosecution of speculation and research in every department of inquiry, and in the composition of numerous courses of lectures on scientific and philosophical questions. The chief difference in general character between the new school and the Academy is that while the scientific interests of the Platonists centred in mathe-, matics, the main contributions of the Lyceum to science lay in ^ the departments of biology and history.”**
  - No departmentalization. Inquire everything. The infinitely diverse minds and knowledge is in a place without restraint or direction.
  - Just a porch is all that is needed. And not even that during sunny days. A place and time. Nothing more.
  - Communication. Consensus. Action.

“…**while Plato's lectures have perished, his books have come down to us. Aristotle's books have almost wholly been lost, but we possess many of his lectures.** The " works " of Aristotle praised by Cicero for their eloquence were philosophical dialogues, and formed the model for Cicero's own compositions in this kind. None of them have survived, though some passages have been preserved in quotations by later writers. That the " works " are actually the MSS. of a lecturer posthumously edited by his pupils seems clear from external as well as irom internal evidence.”

“**Philosophy, as understood by Aristotle, may be said to be the organised whole of disinterested knowledge, that is, knowledge which we seek for the satisfaction which it carries with itself, and not as a mere means to utilitarian ends. The impulse which receives this satisfaction is curiosity or wonder, which Aristotle regards as innate in man, though it does not get full play until civilisation has advanced far enough to make secure provision for the immediate material needs of life,**”
  - The childish wonder, curiosity, is lost once one sees that people still do not have the provisions necessary to live. Then, all focus, awareness, is directed toward that. How can I ever go back to those wonderful game ideas when people still don’t have the essentials? How could Aristotle maintain that state of wonder during a time when Alexander conquered most of the developed world? [Blind privilege.] Should one? Wouldn’t it have been ethically better to be a saint? What good did Aristotle do?

Excerpt From: Taylor, A. E. (Alfred Edward), 1869-1945. “Aristotle.” iBooks. 





classification of the sciences:
“Classification of the Sciences. —To begin with, we have to discriminate Philosophy from two rivals with which it might be confounded on a superficial view. Dialectic and Sophistry. **Dialectic is the art of reasoning accurately from given premisses, true or false.** This art has its proper uses, and of one of these we shall have to speak. **But in itself it is indifferent to the truth of its premisses.** You may reason dialectically from premisses which you believe to be false, for the express purpose of showing the absurd conclusions to which they lead. Or you may reason from premisses which you assume tentatively to see what conclusions you are committed to if you adopt them. In either case **your object is not directly to secure truth, but only to secure consistency.** Science or Philosophy aims directly at truth, and hence requires to start with true and certain premisses. **Thus the distinction between Science and Dialectic is that Science reasons from true premisses, Dialectic only from " probable " or " plausible " premisses.”**
.
**“Sophistry differs from Science in virtue of its moral character. It is the profession of making a living by the abuse of reasoning, the trick (of employing logical skill for the apparent demonstration o^ scientific or ethical falsehoods.** "The sophist is one who earns a living from an apparent but unreal wisdom." (The emphasis thus falls on the notion of making an " unreal wisdom" into a trade. The sophist's real concern is to get his fee.) Science or Philosophy is thus the disinterested employment of the understanding in the discovery of truth.”
  - sounds like psychiatrists, quack-doctors that work for rich people.

“Speculative or Theoretical Philosophy differs from Practical Philosophy in its purpose, and, in consequence, iu its subject-matter, and its formal logical character. The purpose of the former is the disinterested contemplation of truths which are what they are independently of our own volition; its end is to hioio and only to hnow. The object of " practical" Science is to know, but not only to know but also to turn our knowledge to accourft in devising ways of successful interference with the course of events. (The real importance of the distinction comes out in Aristotle's treatment of the problems of moral and social science. Since we require knowledge of the moral and social nature of men not merely to satisfy an intellectual interest, but as a basis for a sound system of education and government. Politics, the theory of government, and Ethics, the theory of goodness of conduct, which for Aristotle is only a subordinate branch of Politics,

B

belong to Practical, not to Theoretical Philosophy, a view which is attended by important consequences.)”

…“Practical Philosophy has to do with relations which human volition can modify, "things which may be other than they are," the contingent. (Thus e.g. not only politics, but medicine and economics will belong to Practical Science.)”…“**Those of the former are universal truths deducible with logical necessity from self-evident^ principles. Those of the latter, because they relate to what "can be otherwise," are never rigidly universal; they are general rules which hold good " in the majority of cases," but are liable to occasional exceptions owing to the contingent character of the facts with which they deal.**”

…

“he marks the difference between Mathematics and First Philosophy by saying that "whereas the objects of First Philosophy are separate from matter and devoid of motion, those of Mathematics, though incapable of motion, have no separable existence but are inherent in matter." Physics is concerned with the study of objects which are both material and capable of motion.”

…

“It follows also that the initial axioms or postulates of Mathematics form a less simple system than those of First Philosophy, and those of Physics than those of Mathematics.”


…

“Practical Philosophy is not subjected by Aristotle to any similar subdivision.”…“His general name for the theory of conduct is Politics, the doctrine of individual conduct being for him inseparable from that of the right ordering of society.”

…

“No special recognition is given in Aristotle's own classification to the Philosophy of Art.”

idea: everyone should have a wearable display of how much money (in assets and non-assets [liquid]) that they have. What would happen?

I should wear a shirt that says that I’m genetically Indian, American-born, multi-cultured (VA, NY, TW).

old idea: game about my experience in Lanyu, exaggerated. Wandering about nature, hunting fish and other sea creatures, eating it, learning local culture through elderly (how to hunt, how to eat, how to craft), craft, library with a language I barely understand, people speaking a language that I don’t understand. With cut-scenes of me doing those things, such as capturing a cute crab and cooking it. Mini-games to expressions of creatures.

todo: 
0. get a nose ring, and maybe some earrings

1. I should find a place to pitch my tent in Tainan, and find a method to gain capital. Have a sign that says, will do good work for money (food and/or for homeless, etc.)? Keep that next to my tent.

Practice vandalism and public art, especially against inequality of capital (housing, cars, rich religious institutions, rich governmental institutions, rich educational institutions, etc.).

main writing:
“While the liberty of the rich and poor can coexist, the property of the wealthy sets alongside the poverty of the many.”{1} Not about fighting for equality of rights (liberty, etc.), but fighting against inequality of materials (capital [property, money]) and the power that comes with it.

[todo: get notes from the two audiobooks / the great courses, John Searle’s and Rick Roderick’s, about social institutions.]

3. In order for me to become an EMT / fireman, I need for the permissions of (certificate, etc.) of at least the institutions of some language institute, some health / fire education department, and maybe some national government, all of which themselves require certificates of institutions (nationality passport, health, etc.), all of which those-selves requires much money for the bureaucratic work. Money (an institution itself), which is gained as a result of wage labour, which is partly the reason to desire to become an institutionalized EMT / fireman (as opposed to an independent rescuer) (in the first place).

2. Perhaps learning some simple method of making money (busking, crafting) is better. It’s at least independent, so that I can maintain my moral [ethics] and mind. It is ethically better, just as being a bum is better than most wage laborers. [todo: learn more: massage, website-making, game-making {digital distribution! — film, performance art, anything}, cooking]

To direct my attention toward money, in a serious and logical manner, has taken me nearly 10 years.

reading [continued on 21/12/2016]:


institutional power:

Hugo Grotius:
…the study of human nature was seen as sufficient to inform policy and lawmakers. Put simply, human behavior produces the natural law. People have certain natural rights that are intrinsic to them, and which aren to bestowed by God or the sovereign. Rather, liberty is a natural right.

right to life and property

freedom of the seas

Thomas Paine (only looked at diagram):
Property owners abuse their position of privilege to run society for their own benefit.
->
This breeds resentment among the poor, who will rise up against the rich if their needs are neglected.
[todo: re-read the natural law vs law paragraph]

Giuseppe Mazzini:
ideology: nationalism
focus: rights and duties
**The pursuit of individual rights is insufficient for the social good…**
->
**…because not everyone is able to exercise their rights.**
  - this is why I normally don’t care for rights (and laws): what’s the point if people can’t use them?
-> [and?]
**…because the pursuit of individual interests leads to greed and conflict.**
->
Individual rights should be subsumed under the duty to one’s country
->
Say not I, but we.

[todo: get the paragraph beginning with First…]

Mazzini argued that the pursuit of rights came second to a higher call of duty toward humanity. This duty required individuals to cooperate toward common aims.

Mikhail Bakunin:
**The privileged man is a man depraved in intellect and heart.**
->
**The privileged tend to run state institutions…**
->
**so state institutions become corrupt**
->
  - this part needs more work. **How do corrupt institutions enslave people?** Because the rules created by institutions contain and/or dictate everyday life.
and the masses are enslaved
->
to be free and fulfilled, all authority must be rejected



Peter Kropotkin
In The Conquest of Bread (1892), Kropotkin argued that the best aspect of humanity—its ability to cooperate—could allow it to do away with all oppressive structures. He saw in the developing labor movement the possibility to overthrow oppressors —from priests to capitalists—and establish a new society based on mutual respect and cooperation. He lay down the principles of what was to become **anarcho-communism: belief in a collaborative, egalitarian society, free of the state.**
  - hmm, could apply to a collection of civic-spaces? That only works in a society where people actually care about others. Dense areas in Taiwan, not America.

Call to Action:
**Anarchism is a theory of action**,…**Establishing a new world did not require fresh rules, but anarchists able to act courageously against all oppression.** Compromise and political calculation were alien to anarchism; instead, **its adherents must act with moral fervor against a corrupt world.** Kropotkin, like other anarchists, helped define the “politics of the deed”—a belief that would recur in radical ideologies over the next century.
  - it’s not a job, it’s a constant call to action. Continuously be active in life. As Taiwanese people are in protests. Be political. Be a part of political society. Do not merely believe that it is the job of politicians or others. It is everyone’s duty. This is where Taiwan really shines.

**1960s - Counterculture movements in Europe and the US squat in empty buildings and form communities.**

…[todo: a lot more probably here]

Michel Foucault:
**Political thought has long been concerned with how best to define and locate the source of power in society. Many of the most significant political works have imagined a powerful state as the center of legitimate political authority.**…power…was diffused across a great many “micro-sites” throughout society (such as schools, workplaces, and families).

[ todo: need to read second page]

Chomsky:
[todo: most of the article is a highlight]

others: 
Sun Yat-Sen:
Unlike many of his contemporaries, he stressed the strengths of Chinese culture, fusing a respect for China’s history with an appropriation of Western values.
  - there’s a TON of meaning behind this one, comparing values, slightly grasping more economic / capitalist values

In recent years, communist China has increasingly come to embrace Sun’s legacy, citing him as an inspiration behind its move to a market-led economy.

“Our society is not free to develop and the common people do not have the means of living.”
  - :(

Non-violence:
Ghandi (skimmed):
Gandhi was influenced by Jainism, **a religion whose central principle is to avoid harming living things.** Jain monks wear masks so that they do not inadvertently breathe in insects.

Gandhi was married at the age of just 13. Five years later, his father sent him to London to study law. He was called to the bar in 1891 and set up a law practice in South Africa, defending the civil rights of Indian migrants. While there, Gandhi embarked upon a strict course in brahmacharya, or Hindu self-discipline, beginning a life of asceticism. In 1915, he returned to India, where he took a vow of poverty and founded an ashram. Four years later, he became head of the Indian National Congress. He was killed on his way to prayer by a Hindu extremist who blamed him for the Partition of India and the creation of Pakistan.

Forms of nonviolent protest, from blocking roads to boycotting goods, have become popular and powerful methods of civil disobedience in today’s political world.

Malcom X:
…politicians often renege on promises made during elections when they assume office
  - true, have to check promises
->
If politician do not deliver the equality they promise in elections, black Americans should turn to violence to achieve their aims
  - hmmm, no reason for violence here, but alright!
->
The ballot or the bullet.

…MLK took inspiration from the nonviolent protest of Mahatma Gandhi in India, and built a similar movement that began to gain sympathy from all areas of society. However, the slow pace of change and the continued oppression of black people in America led many to contest this approach.
  - ahhh true, non-violence really is too slow. Need change now! And violence *is* a way.

…**Malcolm believed the struggle for equality was closely bound up with the people’s ability to determine their lives for themselves, and therefore any attempt to restrict those rights should be met with direct action, and, if necessary, force.**
  - absolutely. Be active!

…Malcolm remained skeptical about the likelihood that the extension of voting rights would promote real change in the US…

Martin Luther King:
**Discrimination is the result of fervently held beliefs**
->
**However wrong, these beliefs lead people to commit barbaric acts.**
->
**Nothing in the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance.**
->
A change in attitudes is needed to tackle discrimination.

**“Freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.”**

[todo: need to finish reading.]

Solidarity (and other “politics” that makes sense to me, or feels human; culture, area, community):
Aristotle:
[todo: get stuff]

Mencius:
[todo in directory]

Johann Gottfried Herder:
**People are shaped by the places they grow up…**
  - YES
->
…because shared languages and landscapes help to create a national spirit or Voklsgeist.
  - YES, nature and human language are huge cultural factors
->
The national spirit forges a community with a particular national character.
  - yes, but only if that nation has a single culture. In the case of multiple cultures, things are more complex.
->
People depend on this national community for happiness
  - I did! But, should the nation be a community? Or should it be a smaller place — city, neighborhood, family?
->
Each nationality contains its center of happiness within itself.


Johann Herder, however, believed that a search for universal truths based solely on reason was flawed, since it neglected the fact that human nature varies according to cultural and physical environments. People need a sense of belonging, and their outlook is shaped by the places they grow up in.
  - a lot of ideas in here. Psychology, of memory, of sense of home, of human understanding that goes beyond all this political reasoning bullshit.

Herder’s idea of a national center of gravity also ignores the diversity of views and cultures within each nation, and leads to national stereotyping. His emphasis on national culture neglects other influences—such as economics, politics, and social contacts with different people—making his views less credible in the modern, globalized world. Arguably, he overestimated the prominence of nationality in people’s priorities, which can be swayed by anything from family ties to religious views.

Johannes Althusius:FederalismConsociation

**Humans associate in groups at different levels: families, organizations, cities, provinces, and states.**
->
The purpose of the state is to protect members of its associations and their communications.
  - hmmm…protect, yes: harm principle. Protect communication, yes: right to communicate.
->
Elected states representatives must reflect the many views of these differing associations.
  - representative democracy…okay…but can such a complex world of infinite views be represented?
->
Politics is the art of associating men.
-> yes!

[todo: **the entire article is a highlight!**]

Althusius claimed that **human communities**—from private ones, such as families and organizations, to public ones, such as cities—**are autonomous entities that came into being through a form of social contract.**
  - sounds like Aristotle.

Like Aristotle, Althusius believed that people are sociable, and in order to live peaceably together, they are happy to share goods and services and respect one another’s rights. **Each consociation of individuals begins when someone recognizes a shared need, service, or set of values, and is willing to contribute to the welfare of a group.**
  - yep, shared values in the case of post-survival societies, and yep again to willingness to contribute to the group. **Shared values and volunteerism.**

**Bottom-up**, not top-down:
He believed **power and authority should move upward via consociations**, not down from a sovereign. **While consociations are independently subordinate to the state, collectively, they are superior to the state.** The government sits at the top of a hierarchy of consociations, and its task is to administer the commonwealth made up of the various interacting groups. **It, too, is a part of the social contract**, recognizing and sharing the aims, values, goods, and services of its people and coordinating their communications.
  - This! Thus, it’s the independent “consociations”, or more commonly now, “communities”, whether that is family, city, state, that group together in ever so larger groups of consociations. So the government should be thought of as merely ~”coordinating the consociations’ communications”, nothing more. That doesn’t require many people. Let the city / county-wide consociations be the bulk of government workers.

The elected representatives of the government do not represent individuals or a single common will, but a plurality of wills—of all the communities that exist within the one larger community of the nation.

Modern federalism (ex. US Constitution) is based on individualism, not social groups.
  - I think what it meant is that US representatives don’t quite represent a conglomerate of social groups, rather, just a [single] bunch of people. There are not groupings. Because the world is modern? Individuals now don’t belong to many communities. Or the communities in the modern world are too numerous and complex, not place-based, but now digital and otherwise.

Rousseau:
Human beings free from society were well-disposed, happy creatures, content in their state of nature. **Only two principles guided them: the first, a natural self-love and desire for self-preservation; the second, a compassion for their fellow human beings. The combination of the two ensured that humanity reproduced itself, generation after generation, in a state close to that of other animals.**
  - 1. survival, in an animal way. 2. compassion. — I kind of love this. But it’s too simple.

Jean-Jacques Rousseau:
“You are undone if you once forget that the fruits of the Earth belong to us all, and the Earth itself to nobody.”

…it was during his time in the Italian island-port of Venice— while working as an underpaid ambassadorial secretary—that he decided “everything depends entirely on politics.”

Arne Naess:
“Shallow ecology” and “deep ecology” terms the difference of technological changes to help the environment vs behavioral (social and political) changes to help the environment, just as said in the beginning of How to Raise a Wild Child.—

inequality:

Jean-Jacques Rousseau:
Rousseau’s autobiographical Confessions, published after his death, reveal that it was during his time in the Italian island-port of Venice— while working as an underpaid ambassadorial secretary—that he decided **“everything depends entirely on politics.” People were not inherently evil, but could become so under evil governments. The virtues he saw in Geneva, and the vices in Venice—in particular, the sad decline of the city-state from its glorious past—could be traced not to human character, but to human institutions.**
  - hmmm, I wonder what viruses and vices he saw
  - [todo: read 1754 Discourse on the Origin and Basis of Inequality Among Men, Confessions]
  - [todo: get more highlights from Rousseau]

On property and inequality:
…This happy condition was, however, brutally brought to a close by the creation of civil society and, in particular, the development of private property. The arrival of private property imposed an immediate inequality on humanity that did not previously exist— between those who possessed property, and those who did not.

By instituting this inequality, private property provided the foundations of further divisions in society—between those of master and slave, and then in the separation of families. On the foundation of these new divisions, private property then provided the mechanism by which a natural self-love turned into destructive love of self, now driven by jealousy and pride, and capable of turning against other human beings. It became possible to possess, and acquire, and to judge oneself against others on the basis of this material wealth. Civil society was the result of division and conflict working against a natural harmony.
  - [todo: holy fuck, requires thinking]

The loss of liberty:
…Establishing a ruler superior to the rest of society transformed humanity’s natural equality into a permanent, political inequality…

…Rousseau argued, they [social contracts] were formed after we had left the state of nature, and property rights—with the resultant inequalities—had been established. Once property rights were in place, conflicts would ensue over the distribution of those rights. It was civil society and property that led to war, with the state as the agency through which war could be pursued.
—

reasons for revolution:

Jean-Jacques Rousseau:
States formed under illegitimate social contracts based on the fraud of the powerful were not capable of expressing this will, precisely because their subjects were bound to them only by deference to authority, not by mutual assent. However, if the apparent contracts between rulers and ruled were illegitimate, based on a denial of people’s sovereignty rather than its expression, it would follow that the people had every right to depose their rulers. That, at least, is how the more radical of Rousseau’s later followers came to interpret him.
—
general conclusions:
Many of the ideas trend toward natural growth, non-force, non-politics: “de-unification” of Italy, desist of Western intervention of Islam, the natural women’s movements of Iranian women within Islamic culture, de-colonialism, etc. Leave the cultures to themselves. Bottom-up development, self-development. A kind of **Taoist way for state and culture.**

Overall, politics is useless compared to sociology.
