[Starting in rural Japan, as usual][]. The view of the islands as real and as incredible as reality. It reminds me of islands (and boats!) off of Hong Kong, Kyushu, and Taiwan. Kids swim freely, as in Lanyu, Taiwan.

Momo’s entrance to boring rural life is as real as it gets, with still heat, fans, long baths, and loneliness. With those material things, the loneliness allows [memories to pour][Omoide Poro Poro]. And again, just as in [Shinkai’s films][Voices of a Distant Star], one must deal with loss. And again, one’s imagination seeps through the medium of animated video.

Upon first viewing, the film is heart-achingly good, of coming-to-age problems, child-parent problems, and passing time through depression, with the help of a slapstick god.

What’s incredible of the film comes in bits during the first viewing, but more clearly upon skipping through a second time: that Momo is exploring the island, alone; The fantastic parts can be ignored without altering Momo’s actions, much: She goes into the attic to read books, runs around town, finds little solace near a temple, runs up a hill, views the island from atop, adventuring; All whilst slowly transitioning — place and state of mind.

Adventure, fantasy, and reality mix. Did she really steal vegetables? When she receives and reads a letter from the festival boat (near the end), her mother accepts her fantasy.

For the creator of story, **adventure created memories**.
