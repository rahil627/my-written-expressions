Made me cringe. :(

To be able to laugh at that [video] or brag about actually doing anything ("practice"), one is also laughing at about how useless [theoretical] most other American education in politics is, which includes the cumulative wasted capital [and time] and brainwashing on / of the privileged few that have access to it. Not funny. Perhaps humorous to those within an academic culture.

I really want to like a person who can rep the community they came from (rural China? or not?), but it seems that either [1] education transformed one into them or [2] one must at time do things to suck up / maintain one's position in academia. I hope it's the second. And further, I hope one can go back home.ï»¿
