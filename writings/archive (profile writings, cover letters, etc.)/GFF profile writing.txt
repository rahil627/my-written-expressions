Hey all.

First of all: This is my first time trying GFF. Just trying some CouchSurfing (CS) alternatives because now the CS community’s economic values and expectations feel a bit high, increasing that awful feeling of forced tourism and/or gift-reciprocity (ex. language exchange), as opposed to, you know, just hanging out! Besides, this old school web format is totally awesome and efficient! :D

Anyway, I recently had an amazing experience in Lanyu (蘭嶼) which brought me quite close to nature, which is kind of provoking the childhood me again. Yay! Thus, I’m looking for agricultural jobs in Taiwan, especially farming and fishing. Real jobs! Not some silly volunteering or tourism or “work exchange” or “hospitality exchange”, but real labor. This point is very important to get across in Taiwan. I’m in American ethic working-mode yo!

My plan is to rent a scooter from Taipei and wander around farms and harbors until I find something interesting. Any accommodation along the way would be nice. Otherwise, I have my tent and know how to use it, so don’t worry. :)

If I fail to find some labor work here, I’ll continue to Japan, with intention to hitch-hike across that entire country. My current goal is just to enough money to pay for Emergency Medical Technician (ambulance people) classes in the Philippines. And, hopefully, along the way, get some more farm, fishing, and physical experience, as I did in the wonderful Lanyu island. :)

About me? I guess I was a digital nomad, but now I’m just a nomad.

I hope people still use this website!
