Heya,

My friend and I are really interested in this room. Our main concern is that we want to share the room. I know, this is unorthodox, but we're just two straight guys that'd like to live together. If this isn't okay, no worries =).

If so, I wrote a little about ourselves below so you can determine if we are good fit. We're free to meet up nearly any time, as long as there is a notice.

Hoping to hear from you soon!,
Rahil

I know those are ambitious career choices but don't worry, we have money (programming pays well!), guarantors, and are capable of holding a steady a job. We enjoy the things that typical city-dwellers do: indie media, museums, concerts, food fairs, bikes, open mic, and anything art-related.
