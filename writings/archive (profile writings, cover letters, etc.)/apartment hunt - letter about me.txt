Heya,

I'm really interested in this room. I wrote a little about me below so you can determine if I am a good fit. I am free after 9pm on weekdays but prefer meeting during weekends.

Hoping to hear from you soon!,

My story:
I'm a nerdy almost 24 year old who's followed, until now, a predictable path of in life. I've lived at home in Virginia, helping my family with house chores and their hospitality business. I graduated from a local college in 2009 and worked locally for a year as a software developer. I indulged in eclectic media (foreign/new wave films, indie music, the internet) because my hometown is sooo booooring. This should be quite a turning point in my life, as I am introverted, but have ambition.

I'm rather quiet. I don't drink/smoke (but can handle it all). I enjoy attending events: museums, concerts, food fairs, and anything art-related. I'm able to deal with most personalities really well, probably because I'm patient. I'm usually down for anything, and never deny favors.

I arrived in SF in January and started working at a video game company in Foster City. Currently, I commute via public transportation (1.5-2 hours), but after three months of that I've decided to look for a job in downtown. My sublease is about to expire, so I'm starting to look for another room. My current room isn't in the coziest apartment. The living room was converted, and the kitchen is tiny. I'm really looking for a place I could call home. A place with a living room or a dining table in which roommates and friends can gather. I imagine most of my time will be spent: working, eating, exploring the city, attending events, working on other aspirations (film and music)...and eating more.
