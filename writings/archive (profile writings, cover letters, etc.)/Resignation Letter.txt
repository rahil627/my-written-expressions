note: this wasn't the final letter, I edited at work.

To Kenny and Vimal,

I've decided over the weekend that I want to resign.

I've mentioned this to Vimal once, but I didn't think it would be this soon. I had planned to wait for a convenient time, when there was a larger QA team in place, or when the redesign is over, but I foresee little change in the near future and see no reason to wait any longer. On top of that, some other personal things have recently emerged.

The main reason I am leaving is because the work is very tedious. It keeps me busy without allowing time to learn or do anything creative. I also see no reason to stay to help with automation or become a developer as I've become quite uninterested in the work done at PWE. I prefer a smaller business model than a larger one. It was my fault for choosing a QA position in a large game publisher when I desired a programming position in a small game developer.

Despite all of that, I still enjoy the people and workplace, and would like to thank you for the opportunity and experience.

I’m free to meet and talk about it at any time.

Rahil
