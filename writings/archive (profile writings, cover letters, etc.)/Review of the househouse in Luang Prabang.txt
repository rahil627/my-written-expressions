Review of the househouse in Luang Prabang:
The family that runs Khonesavanh is amazing.

Upon arrival, they only had a tent left, for what I believe was around $3. It worked for me. Luckily there were no mosquitoes in the tent. The next day owner moved me to the room with windows facing the front. The room is large, a bed that fits two comfortably, a hot shower, and an outlet. I don’t remember exactly how much it cost, but I imagine $10.

The greatest thing about staying here is the feeling you get staying in proximity to the owner’s family. The owner once offered me food and served me a full lunch meal and refused taking money. Another time I ask if I can order food, the owner’s wife went out, bought the ingredients, cooked it, and served it at the very reasonable price of $2.

Luang Prabang is extremely touristy, so finding a place of this quality took a little time. Staying with them felt like a little haven from the tourism. I was so glad to find such a place.
