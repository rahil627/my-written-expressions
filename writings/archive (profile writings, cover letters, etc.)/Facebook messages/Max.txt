Anyway, I think I'll be on my last bit of life beginning to make music / busk my butt off for maybe two weeks, then decide to continue busking at either Taipei or Tainan (hang with NSX). Then ultimately decide Australia vs Northern California. I'm beat. Inevitably humans need money, and it's both politically (through migrant policies) and culturally (through unconscious racism) an adverse mountain. So, I give up, and decided to go to a country with good migrant policies (relatively easy perm. residence) and generations of immigrants.

Hope to catch ya one more time when I pass by Taipei though! Also can't wait to be with the SW TW folks one more time! Gah, miss them. Taidong City might be the most backwards place I've been to. What a wildly bad decision to come here, haha. Good weather though.
