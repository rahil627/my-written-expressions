Being a Saint and a Child [todo: not blogged yet]

> “**Philosophy, as understood by Aristotle, may be said to be the organised whole of disinterested knowledge, that is, knowledge which we seek for the satisfaction which it carries with itself, and not as a mere means to utilitarian ends. The impulse which receives this satisfaction is curiosity or wonder, which Aristotle regards as innate in man, though it does not get full play until civilisation has advanced far enough to make secure provision for the immediate material needs of life,**”

  - The childish wonder, curiosity, is lost once one sees that people still do not have the provisions necessary to live. Then, all focus, awareness, is directed toward that. How can I ever go back to those wondrous idea-generating period when people still don’t have the essentials? How could Aristotle maintain that state of wonder during a time when Alexander conquered most of the developed world? Blind privilege? Goal-oriented [instrumental?] rationality? Should one? Wouldn’t it have been ethically better to be a saint? What *good* did Aristotle do?

Is it a choice? Can’t one be both, curious, yet letting one’s body do the chore-like essential work? Work toward survival with the energy of a child raised in nature? Be a saint and a child?

The body can only do so much in one day.
