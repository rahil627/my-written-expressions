Hmmm, well, I love my childhood, therefore I love my hometown, or, rather, at least my neighborhood: College Park. I was in high school when we moved to another town, so all of my memories are contained in that nostalgia-inducing cul-de-sac suburb. Every other place in the world is seen through the lens of that place.

My backyard had an old swing-set, and over the fence there was a ditch usually full of tadpoles that ran behind the houses. I have no idea what the purpose was, but to me, at the the time, it was an obstacle to jump over. There were wooden bridges, bushes that bore wild berries, and, "shortcuts" to friends' houses. The ditch was a natural pathway to anywhere in the world. Or, at least, my neighborhood.
