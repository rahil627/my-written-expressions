some repeated thoughts:

## caring people are the most attractive / the limits of humans within the system
Was it, the entire time (of my life? of at least Taiwan), that the main attractiveness of people and culture derived from a care for the environment [including people]?

Was that what really led me from sub-urban VA to the communal areas of Taiwan? Perhaps eventually to solitude?

Is that what happened to Alex of Into The Wild? That as he became more educated, the amount of moral rules increased, caring more for everything, that, eventually, he trekked into solitude too?

The communities I've lived in all have had a care to a certain degree, trying to care as much as it can for the time each individual has. But the cities only allow so much time.

## role models and role communities (and against isolation)
[Communes] and [those fiercely ideal people that organize them] are role models for society. They create events which involve living together: vegan festivals, natural markets. People camp for a few days, cook together, eat together, sleep together, clean together.

By watching the elders cook, clean, care, do, the younger ones follow in their own natural ways.

But does it work?

Some of the younger ones are influenced. The tourists who are there for a day, a certain performance, probably aren't. Only the volunteers get the full experience and influence, and are probably already good, hence they volunteer.

Thus, it doesn't really work. It only affects volunteers, who were already *in*. The others go un-influenced.

What's the point then?

What's the point of trying to educate others if others are too habituated, un-willing to learn, blind?

Hope and optimism must exist to keep trying to educate.

Pessimism results in completely detached hippies.

What's the point of living without that kind of hope? What does one do with their time? Consume drugs and media? That's the ugly parts of America.

Anarchic communities are hopeful of social progress. Hippie communities are not, detached from society.

Cities too, are hopeful. Sub-urbs are not.

Hope is the driving motivation behind most living in cities and progressive communities. Without hope, the other areas continue with their same culture, ignorantly, un-conciously.

Anarchic communities are cities, in the sense that they are the most progressive (diverse in mind) areas (in the world). More complex than cities and their institutions because they are smaller in population, with more diverse individuals (and minds). Thus, anarchic communities are the greatest institutions, and therefore the best place to be in.

But when they are separated from the city, the rural, everyone else, there is a severe lack of human connection, solidarity. The anarchic community is supposed to be a *role community* for the place it resides in, i.e. the city, town, country it is in. Thus, the anarchic community must have ties to other people [out-side of it]: independent people, farmers, vegetarian restaurants, recycling aunties, and other good people.

The network builds. The community grows. Until it takes over the area it resides in. That's the revolution. A slow one.

But what if the community that takes over has holes? Then, I guess, a more progressive anarchic community is created within it, and the process repeats.

Never mix money and [pure] work.

Get money, however one can, then, do whatever you desire. That's freedom in capitalism.
