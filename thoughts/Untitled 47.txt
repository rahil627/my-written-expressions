4/10/2017:
top tens web-site:
UK - created the slave trade, oppressed more than one country from every continents, and have been in more wars than any other nation. Bengal famine, twice, Irish famine, atrocities in Kenya, Malaysia, and Northern Ireland.
France - seems to be mixed between hate without reason and love. The main reason might be colonizing 14 African countries.
Sweden - xenophobic/racist, unhealthy “feminism”, mostly due to being isolated for so long
a comment by Jimmy Sizzle: most countries have been destroyed by “feminism”. His list: Columbia, Chile, Brazil...Italy (especially Southern Italy including Sicily), Brazil...Morocco. That is, if you enjoy real women, making an honest living, not in a Jew-rigged system, without LGBT domination and the pc police...He says that most of the countries on the list have no culture (the same old Western boring developed countries). He says although France, Spain, and Germany have culture, no thanks...he asks for people who made the list to include immigration policies and the chance of being employed, along with weather, scenic beauty, etc.

gender:
androgyny wiki article:
  -  sex identity sub-section: does not neatly fit masculine or feminine roles, may identify as something in-between (lots of words like inter-) or neither (non-gender, agender, etc.)...basically, people act naturally for each context. They have the virtues of both genders.
  - bem-sex role inventory?: feminine = expressive, masculine = instrumental, both = androgyny, none = undifferentiated
tomboy wiki article, history and society sub-section: tomboy, a phase around 8-13 years of age, involves male (boy-ish) behavior. Though not linked with sexual orientation, it seems that most people who identify themselves as tomboys are indeed lesbians.

California Valley and other West Coast ciites:
wiki article: *half of the country’s fruits, vegetables, and nuts* are produced here!
question on Quora site: pros and cons: pros: nature, open space, etc. cons: lack of diversity — politically, ethnically, every way possible; air quality sucks because it’s a dust bowl (basin); need car to get anywhere interesting beyond your neighborhood
wiki article on Portland: one of the most environmentally-conscious cities, only directly elected metro-planning committee, commission-based government; one of the best street food; most micro-breweries too
wiki article on Sacramento: marketed as farm-to-table city
some site: a person compares San Diego with NYC: San Diego closes after sun-down. Need a car or motorcycle to get anywhere. NYC has a ton of experiences to be had all day and night.
some traveling article: Western Australia fits the pictures of Australia in most peoples’ minds. It’s far less developed... Great Ocean road
city-data forums post: someone compares Sydney to Melbourne: basically, Sydney is better in every-way, generally, just livelier, whereas Melbourne is subdued. The weather in Sydney is better too, sunnier, with proximity to beaches.


from someone’s blog (~JustinLarbalester): Side-by-side Sydney-New York comparison writing:
Basically the guy says that in Australia, people are unenthusiastic, without direction, without compassion, without care for art, ideas, concepts, and so forth. He went to college in Sydney. He doesn’t miss it. In NYC, in contrast, he had a great experience with people that attend its many schools, of long, exciting philosophical and action-oriented discussions with several peers during many reminiscent nights. He felt he could like sports and intellectual dialogs without being disliked for liking either of them. Next page: more harassment in Sydney. more eyes and noises in New York, but in a more social / public and less creepy way. Pedestrians rule in NYC, well, Manhattan. Cars rule in Sydney.

internet readings around immigration policies:
from some site: the people who come to America, lottery or not, are special. They are willing to start anew... a family, a business. They have an entreprenuer spirit.
from another site: a graph that shows success rate of political parties that use xenophobic (and therefore racist) ideas. It only contains European countries. Basically, Eastern Europe has large percents, notably Poland and Croatia with the highest (worst), then Denmark, then Sweden, Finland, Austria, Hungary, etc., whereas Western Europe has smaller percents, notably Estonia Czech Republic, Germany, and France all near zero.
