written Friday night:
long day-dream of having the retro-roomanians talk about and conversation of reminisces of past competitive times, teenage years, what’s cool, being good, avoiding peer pressure, cool kids that passed away, trash-talking, hustling, stories upon stories, characters, jokes, etc.
  - can it be done digitally?

Cold weather? Feeling self, masturbate wearing female tunic, panties, and, for the first time, tried clipping the nipples with weak clothes-line clips. Much of sex for me, it seems, is feeling, groping, biting, etc. and me reacting to that. Which is, much like a female. Reaction. Interaction. Sex is just a game of interaction.

Still feeling super rational. No heat. Just doing the work. Cold, rational. Not overly conscious or aware of things. Able to focus on money. Hopefully. At least, for a moment.

Auntie. Church. Looking for work during the day. At the library? Or just outside. Search for [motorcycle] delivery, mover, [small] truck, physically moving objects type of work. Sort of timed, but doable at my own pace. Farming, packaging, etc. may also be okay. Cooking, however, is not; That would probably only work for being the cook at a restaurant with only a few customers, being able to cook at a leisurely pace.

What other jobs are possible (for my personality)? [todo: worth Googling] Post office? Too institutinalized, nearly requiring slave-length contracts. Teaching philosophy might work, as would day-care sort of free spaces. But both often face institutionalization.

This thought leads to a thought I had recently thought of: Institutionalization vs real? Was it that thought? Hmmm. Anyway, institutionalization is something I’ve been avoiding forever, even since my first job search. Looking for a place where I can just be human. It’s difficult. Surprisingly difficult. Ah! That’s it...

I also have difficult doing jobs that require me to focus on the work, which is, most jobs. I actually prefer, don’t mind, doing brainless jobs. And, when are jobs brrainless? When they are institutionalized. A cog in a machine. Helplessness blues. It’s such a wild oxymoron: an anarchic rebel working happily working as a cog in a machine, yet, like McCandless working at McDonald’s, it works. It’s just work. Do it, plan the next moves, then do it. The mind isn’t at the job, it’s on what your attention is on. It stays there. Any job that takes my attention away from where I want it will be a pain, unless, I happen to want m attention to be there, which, is often only momentarily. My attention shifts. My intentions shifts, My ethics shifts. My life shifts. I can’t stop it; Or, I don’t want to stop it. It’s natural. It’s life.

What other jobs? Anything temporary, a new skill to me to learn, any job with good friends, but, more in an assisting role, as the focus is likely not near my personal passions: art and anarchy, and, nearly never is, except, in the rare cases of art communities and anarchic or hippie communes.

Anyway, I’ll get there... I’ll get there.

Time to take a jog through the firefly forest? Man... I feel healthy. Sex. Protein. Cool weather. Unconsciousness... I feel like I can do some stupid work and be unconscious for a bit. Listen to some music. Not care of time passed. Not care of all the stupidity of what I’m doing...

An earlier thought, not too long before this writing session: To think that the world is the way it is, the way it is organized in the way that it is, of all the possibilities, industrialized, institutionalized, according to such few possibilities, is insane. Industrialization and institutionalization seem to be the core of everything I’m against: creativity, naturally-designed, natural-living, natural life. Of all the things a human can do, it comes down to this? Ugh.
[todo: worth thinking a lot about...how those two core things derive from capitalism, how the whole world is just a copy of a few ideas...]

Man...wearing less and more comfortable clothing in the bed sure does feel right....

Need to cop this job quick. Get back to the energetic me, working, music, doing things, even if alone, but, can use an internet dating site to keep an eye on matches, real matches—personality, cultures (serious yet fun, anarchy but art, etc., serious life struggles in the body and mind), much like that girl from Hong Kong... She... her mind... was a thing of beauty, shooting every which way: friends, Nietzche, conceptual metaphors and word-concepts, passion. ***Passion!*** Ohhh that word, that idea. That’s all I’m ever looking for. Passion.

Outside of New York, I don’t see it. No passion. Sure, there are people living rough lives, doing rough work, barely getting by, yet, I see no passion. That’s precisely what the Southwest of Taiwan and possibly the States (save LA) lack!: Passion. Yet, that’s precisely what I desire the most. People with passion. [todo: add to dating profile and search]

So...passionate people. Where are they? Only in New York? Only in the cities? Only travelers? Perhaps... Perhaps so. People that live by the hour. Changing the world, at least, according to their minds, by the action. Where living actually matters. Where art matters. Not the traditional world. Neither the institutionalized world. But, that very real world, of artists.

I need to re-gain it. Get out of poverty, then begin passioning again. Is it possible? Or, do I need New York?: A place where passion is reciprocated? Where passion is not reciprocated is not worth living in. Whatever one does, it should be done with passion. Thus, I should cut off anyone and any-place that does not do things passionately.

Who and what places to cut off? Traditional areas. Traditional areas are most impassionate. Traditional areas includes the suburbs, which follow the traditions of institutions through institutionalization. Rural places too. As they, similar to the traditional peoples of traditional towns and neighborhoods, and traditional suburbs, are too moving according to old habits, not changing according to changes of civilization, not adapting. Where does that leave? Just places with artists, I guess... And not any type of artist, but, active, passionate ones. Not artists from traditional areas. Not those artsy personalities either. I mean really passionate, really adaptable, continuously life-shifting peoples, whom aren’t conditioned to any set of habits. The passionate ones willing to change everything in their lives to live with a better set of ethics, to maximize their personality’s potential, to live maximally.

Who and where? They’re out there, but scattered. I have to organize them. I can catch some through the internet. I might be able to catch some locally, but, I don’t really want to deal with handling non-passionate peoples. I’d rather let them continue living their own stupid ways and die off. My home shall be reservered for the passionate. Passionately making, doing, playing, living. In the moment. Every moment. Treating every moment as a moment of infinite possibilities, like a mass protest, like a traveler on a travel high. Yet, controlled, with a home to come back to. A kitchen. A way to get money.

Doing passionate thing alone is no fun. There’s no reciprocation. It’s passion against a bunch of lifeless things. It’s wasted energy. Much of my 20’s, heck, maybe even my entire life(!), feels that way: me being passionate against impassionate people. They just don’t feel it. Only the people in New York and Hong Kong really got that... The adventure.

Thus, I must create a home, organize a few passionate people to either come live with me, or nearby me, to passionately do things together. We can be mobile, for mobile projects, documenting things, rebellious actions, etc. But, first, we do need that home stability. Financial stability. Perhaps even working together passionately, busking, selling things, stealing, whatever—now that’s passion! Those are the people I live for, desire to live with, desire to have. Tiring, yes. But worth living. Otherwise, I see no point.

Can I begin organizing now? How to get these people? How to filter them out? By media? By actions? Keywords? PTT? What public places on the internet can I find and filter them from? Facebook groups? Friends of Place of Arts? Nah, not passionate enough! I need real passion. Every-day passion! **Anarchists.** [todo:] And perhaps try searching on the internet ways to find anarchists who don’t know that word yet.

Once I find them, then what? Try communicating. I’ve communicated with so many, and most just don’t respond. Well, I don’t respond often either... Still, for those that don’t respond lengthily or passionately should be blocked, blacklisted. Basically, I’m creating a whitelist of passionate people.

**Artists passionately art. But, I need to re-route that energy toward real actions.** Not just communication, but, disobedience, traumas, yelling, waking people the fuck up.

Back to communication... What to say? Bring up utopia. Just doing things you’re passionate about. That’s all. Build a place for people to do things they are passionate about, but, beside each other.

At least, I believe, that will capture the idealists: the idealist personalities: the NPs (INTP, ENTP, INFP, ENFP, and INFJ). Basically, the people from Babycastles: Lauren (INFJ), Syed (INTP), Kunal (ENTP), that one girl (INTP)... Or, the people form that Hong Kong group, which was more philosopher-esque.

‘Speakeasys’, ‘open mics’, show and tells, are all *places of passion*. That’s the type of events I should be running. Basically, events that I myself would go to, or, events that a younger me would seek out: a DIY space, a hang-out space, a free place to live, a place to work with a cool group of people. I need to lead the younger mes.

Isn’t that what the Factory did? Sort of. In a way more closed-off, traditional way. I’m way more anti-traditional.

So, perhaps, more like Place of Arts, which was a space where people would just naturally come to, perform, then move on. Yeah. That seems way better. It more about doing what’s natural. Finding ways to allow people to naturally do what they already desire. Facilitating their dreams. **Facilitating turning their dreams into actuality.**

So, yeah, **it’s about coming naturally, but just enough to express intentions. Then, I can jump in to do things together.** I do not, however, want to spend much time on figuring out what their intentions are. The more Chinese-cultured Taiwanese that are unable to express themselves in any way must be thrown out, quickly. There is no time for that. **There is only time for passion and action.**. The traditional peoples must be thrown out immediately. There’s absolutely no time for them. I have to return to zero-tolerance mode again. Art and action, not consideration for the retarded.

Those who respond with a quick okay and follow-up actions are good. Those that don’t must be blocked.

**Passion is the core of the organization**, the idea that brings everyone together. Art or anarchy, it doesn’t matter, as long as one is passionately learning, doing, acting. Even if it’s just philosophy, as long as it’s passionately, the mind is in a similar state, just not at the bodily action portion.

**Passionately trying to change  the world through art and anarchy.**

That really might just leave a few personalities: INTP, ENTP, INFJ, INFP (in a very introverted way: internally passionate not externally), ENFP (in an often shallow way, like a passionate protester). Even then, just the few of us adventuring together, finding ways to make money, live, experiment, art, is worth living for. **It’s romantic.**

**So, organize a few core people, and, adventure together. That’s it. That’s life.**..?

Or, at least, beside each other. We can’t do everything together as we may have different interests, cultures, attentions, state of minds, etc. But, we can at least share passions together, beside each other.

That was the thing about New York: that people just did things passionately, *beside* each other. It’s you beside a Brooklyn full of passionate people. People are expressing their hearts in little spaces, in their actions, in their arts, in their anarchies (organizations). It’s just passion.

**That’s what I need to build, in a more natural area. Forget all of the non-sense of civilization created by thousands of years, all those traditions, institutions, industrializations, and begin at the beginning. Create a Brooklyn in nature.** Or, at least, a Silent Barn in nature. A small artist community.

People with passion are allowed in. People without, aren’t. Have a project? Okay. Just want to sit around? Get out? Well, it may depend on their history.

Yeah, much of determining who should be in and out should depend on their personal history. Not wage labour history, but, history of interests, **history of passions**. It’s easy to tell. It’s even easy to tell on the expressions of people face-to-face. Are they excited? Excited enough to volunteer? Then okay. Otherwise, get out.

So, there needs to be an internet database of peoples’ histories... [todo: digital match-making app idea, for friend-finding] Otherwise... I can steal them from other sites, such as hang-out spaces, meet-ups, etc. **Just some passionate kids, that’s all.** Street artists, not institutionalized ones. DIY’ers. Kids passionatelly making things in their bedrooms.

Well...time to try! Time to get my energy again and direct it toward passion! Do some work. Organize a space (mobile or stationary). Organize some people. And go go go! Can begin organizing people on day one. Who cares! Just do it.

Because otherwise...I am dead. I can’t live on like this. **It’s either passion or suicide.** I need to find some money. Then, I need to use it to buy a phone plan to buy internet to use from home. Then, I need to just call those simple job employers. Then...?

**The passion runs out because there’s no money.** No way to get money from an institution for me. There are too many institutionalized barriers (work visa, stereotypes [race, appearance, etc.]). Though, I think, the east-side should be better. Those people look terrible! Especially the blue-collar workers.

No, **passion** doesn’t run out because there’s no money, it **runs out because there’s no passionate people!** It’s like talking to voids. ***Passionate communication* has no effect on zombies; It only affects other passionate people.** Thus, **all passionate energies must be used toward, with, or beside passionate people.** **Only passionate people reciprocate passionately.** **It’s like playing a game with people who just don’t get it.** It’s just no use or point! The game is not the problem, it’s the people!

**Reduce the world to us and nature. Trash everything else. We must make everything from  within [and through our interactions]. Only us and our arts matter, because human’s inability to learn [and change]**. Or, we must use authority...? Do they even matter? Do zombies matter!? **Are zombies worth caring for?**

**Only if one thinks they are able to change. Personality theory says they can’t.** My personal experience says they can’t too. So, fuck ‘em. Let ‘em live and die. Better off dead though...

**By creating more and more arts, ideas, technologies, [todo: more?...] at least, we can passionately live.** **It doesn’t matter if the people change, does it?**

It kind of does...for the material reality. But, if we isolate ourselves from everyone, does it? Not really. But then, that replicates the suburban isolating effect... I guess we just try, like a passionate flame. Try and try and try, like past passionate organizations. We just make and do art and anarchy. If it works, okay. If it doesn’t, well, it’s worth the try.

Still, **we can exercise authority in many ways... That’s real, guaranteed change. Not through art, but by force.**

**Yes, by calculated force, we can slowly make changes... Though, at this point in technology, it’s probably better to use media to effect change.** Document. Reduce power of those in power. De-fame. **Create technologies to empower people. As in, give power to the people to be equal to those in power.****

**Recording documentaries and piecing it together is probably the best way to create antagonisms.** Then, awareness of the documentaries must be repeated to keep it in the attentions of people...

Perhaps that’s a way to attack institutions... I mean, that what people have already done... So... that doesn’t really change anything... It doens’t wake people up. **It needs to be direct actions. Forget the documentaries.**

Just **actions of disobedience and kindness.** Altering and improving the lives of people.

But..if they are zombies...does it matter? I mean, yeah. If they are prejudiced, coerced, slaves, then, yes. That’s probably how they became slaves, even beyond the limits of zombie personalities. There’s just no need to care about them further. Try to un-enslave them, then, continue living without much regard for them, as they will continue to live stupidly anyway.

**Stripping all power and instilling fear into the stupid people with power should be the highest priority.** **Just ‘robin hood’ them.** **That’s the most direct way to...accomplish any sort of moral justice!**

**Vigilante’ism and ‘robin hood’ are perhaps the most direct, most black and white actions I can think of. It’s direct justice.** **If they aren’t community; If they don’t care for and consider about the people around them, then, they deserve it.** It’s as simple as that. It’s the basic principle of morality of most religions: treats others how you want to be treated. If I were rich and abusing un-equally, I would want to be treated the same way: to be punished.

**The simplest way to solve the world’s problems would be to ‘robin hood’ everyone and spread the money (and assets) equally. It would quickly lead to un-equality again, but, for a moment, there will be some balance. Those who desire money, the jews of the world, will quickly gain power though... So, really, money is not the way.** Money often leads to more money, as does inqueality to more inqueality...

It’s not about the money. It’s about the fear. It’s about teaching what right and wrong. **It’s about teaching others how to treat others equally.** **Then, constantly reminding them, so that un-equal treatment doesn’t re-occur.** That reminder must keep re-occurring in society, in the lives of people every-day. **It should be clear what behaviors are considered un-equal.** **They should be punished for performing un-equal behaviors, so that they remember.** I guess that’s what prisons do... But, for the sake of hagemony, the state doesn’t punish the rich and overtly powerful. **Their punishment should be a reverse of roles of the un-equal behavior.**

Welp... Time to man up... and vigilante.
