More day-dreams. I mean, what else is there to do when your body is en-slaved?

[The day-dream was removed]

Rap can be used as a tool to not only teach the next generations how to hustle or stay alive, but, to criticize anyone and anything that isn’t real. **It’s the perfect platform for real people.** That is, anarchists. Brag about how stupid others are and how much smarter you are? Criticize others rappers. Make it competitive. The goal, however, should be to add anarchy knowledge into the songs, along with somehow making good songs. It should feel good singing it, bringing about an anarchic, antagonistic feeling. It’s political rap. It’s critical rap. It’s negative. Yet, I do need to consider the viewpoint of an institutionalized zombie.

Comedy, a la Chapelle, can also be used as a tool to educate and criticize. As exemplified by the  Chapelle Show, it brought all of the social problems of America to the front. It’s another **way to sneak in good material into media, real material, without dealing with the institutionalized wealthy** owners of television. Comedy, just as Jon Stewat proved too, between South Park and the Chapelle Show, was a way to disseminate real knowledge and information through the medium of comedy, **in a subversive way**, without being in the attention or at fault for criticism, using satire as the ‘scape goat. So, just like rap, I can use comedy to diffuse my own ideas.

Both are particularly good for my personality too, just working out ideas and concepts, then talking them out, through rap songs and comedy routines. They are dense forms of media. Like essays, rap songs and comedy routines may include many ideas and the development of those ideas, just, condensed into certain art forms. The word-smithing of rap lyrics. The spoken word-eque speech and gestures of comedy bits. **The arts make the ideas stick. Stick in a way the public will remember, replay, and re-remember.** That is the crucial pro of these **oral art forms**. Books are much harder to remember for humans. The experience isn’t catchy. It’s not fit to a beat, or a song. **Real knowledge need to fit to daily-consumable ways.** Lectures are a step up from books, yet, even that may not be enough. **Songs and comedy bits, just a few sentences, just a few words, can really stick, can really affect change, alter decisions.** Memorable tunes and lines such as “Life’s a bitch, and then ya’ die.” and “Cash rules everything around me.” become life’s anthems, used as vernacular, meme, and labor-song. Memorable bits such as police sprinkling crack on dead victims of those police, claiming non-black people into black culture, and impersonations of institutionalized white people bring clarity to the differences of cultures: real and institutionalized, institutionalized police and black cultures, hippie pot-smoking white cultures and black culture, etc. **All of them containing very real knowledge... Knowledge that comes so easily that we take it for granted. Yet, it’s the art of creating the rap songs and comedy bits that enable the dissemination of the knowledge.**

Black culture, particularly **black entertainment culture, or, black media culture, consits of a canon of these works.** Examples: Chapelle Show, stand-up comedian routines, singers, rappers, television shows such as Martin and The Fresh Prince..., rap videos, and so on. Somehow, from this media, a culture within a culture is created. It’s not black culture, though, all of them contain it. It’s just a series of works by people of black culture, experienced by those who live in cultures that consume black media. Which is, much of America, especially, suburban and perhaps rural Americans, where the media is most powerfully disseminated [and consumed]. This common set of works consumed by everyone for a certain period of time allows for people to use them as references and metaphors for concepts for casual conversation, every-day conversation even. It builds up, with more references and more concepts. It’s the way we talk in suburban America. Perhaps some time in the past people consumed books and used them for references—literary culture. Instead of pointing to the bureaucratic skit by Chapelle, people would point to Kafka. After books, there were comic books [still are for Japan and East Asia]. Original concepts and past concepts from literature were embossed into comic books: comic book culture. Again, for film culture. Again, for game culture. Now, all of them combined. Somehow, people not only communicate using these media cultures, but create a world-view with them. **The mind consumes it all and puts together a imagined world.**

**Black culture though, unlike much of the creations of the institutionalized West**,—such as Hollywood, music companies, television networks, and other owners of popularly-disseminated media—for the most part, **kept it real.** **’White people’ working in those places produced anything for money. It didn’t matter how fake or useless it was.** Black people working in those places, found ways to keep it real; Two path-ways I previously mentioned: rap music and comedy. Others may include ‘hood’ movies such as Friday, where people actually act very similarly as they would in reality, not too dramatic or far-fetched; spoken word; hip-hop (other than rap); ‘sit-coms’ and so on [todo: hmm, what else?].

**Seemingly distractions, black media has been passing down gems like oral folk songs.** The people catch the right ideas from the mess, and laugh at the rest, joyously. **It’s a contemporary tradition.** A tradition **not only limited to black Americans but to most of Americans, and, even people around the world.** I’ve experienced people in other countries, especially the minority communities, latch on to black media: aboriginals in Taiwan being dark themselves and treated very un-equally by the country’s institutions; More hip, real, people from Korea and Japan, usually in a more counter-cultural way; The relaxed, real people of the Netherlands; The cooler people of other European countries; Those into other real communities such as anarchists, fighting game cultures, sports cultures, and so on. All of them find something in black media culture that they get, just get.

**What they get from black media** can vary: It can be the sensual pleasures (drinks, clubs, sex, fashion, etc.), being cool (just chill, smoking, etc.), fighting (males bragging and flexing), sitting at home and consuming media and loathing work...but, I believe the main component **is being real.**

**But what is *‘being real’*?** Well, it’s not institutionalized (white) people most easily recognized by Chapelle’s impersonations. It’s not office work. It’s more of a neighborhood feel. Being at home. Cooking. Neighborhood life. Cook-outs. House-parties. If there’s any work shown, it’s work on the house, or caring for the community, or even for the garden. It’s not corporate work. It’s real work. The work that the people can see from their neighborhood: post office workers, delivery workers, truckers, Wal-marts, convenient stores. It’s not: financial institutions, educational institutions (except local school systems), corporate institutions, government institutions (unless in order to help real people problems), medical institutions (unless it’s helping people real people problems). **Basically, it’s being rational, rational in a way that’s in tune with reality, in tune with the rhythms of life, in tune with what people are thinking and feeling, in solidarity with the culture; Pragmatic; Following common sense. Institutions often are some form of irrationality, based on traditions that make no sense, isolated from the reality of communities of people, progenated away from reality and implemented at a distance instrumentally.**

As the world alters its own original cultures to shape-shift into something similar to America, fake media is endlessly emulated and reproduced in different languages and fit to different cultures, like Bollywood, but, in every country. Within these places, not a single ounce of realness exists. All heartless money-hoarders following equally heartless money-hoarders, like Chinese versions. Black culture is America’s most prominent real **ethnic culture**, among many others, such as Spanish and Filipino cultures. For the rest of the world, there too are many communities of people that maintain raalness: the aboriginals of Taiwan, the migrant workers of nearly any country (in the case of Taiwan: Indonesians and Vietnamese), minority groups[,] especially those that tend to stray away from institutionalized societies (‘Zomia’), artist communities, outcast (hippies, anarchists, etc.) communities, etc.

**As the institutions degenerate and reproduce degenerate human societies, the real peoples of the world try to maintain realness by ‘keeping it real’ and remembering to do so with canonized *real arts* such rap hooks and comedy sketches.** **The results of doing so: Real dialiects are preserved**: dialects of the American South, or even dialects of aboriginal peoples in other countries, staving off the fake TV news reporter dialects of the institutionalized mass education systems [a popular dispute within public schools in black cultured areas]. **Real behaviors are preserved**: instead of walking around up-right as if one had a butt-plug inserted, people walk around quite casually, perhaps even with some swag or a natural stride, riding a BMX bike or long-board for commutes; Instead of faking being nice, faking smiles, faking ‘yes’s’, being flaky, **people are more direct and truthful**. [todo: really worth thinking of more positive results] Most importantly though, **real people are preserved.**

**It’s through the consumption or experience of interacting with *real people* that we maintain a genuine identity of ourselves.** If it weren’t for real people and the real arts (and media) that they created, the world may have become filled with fake people, robots, as East Asia (Japan, Korea, China) is now: Places where institutionalization consumes the entire day from the near 12-hour mass “education” (brain-wash) which begins at a very young age, to the near 10-hour mass “employment” (excess wage labour”)...[todo: can write some more here...]

Though I believe that some personalities are more resistant to institutionalization (or just brain-wash in general), especially the dreamers (INFP) and myself (INTP), **we are a minority fighting against a majority of more easily malleable slates.** So, we need all of the tools we can use to make up for that, and, *real media* is one such tool. Making real media to maintain real cultures, whether it’s Black American culture, anarchist culture, punk culture, Taiwanese aboriginal culture, certain lower-class suburban neighborhoods, or the ghettos of the world, it doesn’t matter. What matters is that the trait of realness is within in the culture, that somewhere in the ethics of life people are acting genuinely, *normal*, *naturally*. **Making *real arts* about the ethics of *real people*.** That’s one way to combat the institutions.

Documenting real people (art communities, ethnic enclaves and cultures, outcast communities, that film about scavengers). ‘Hood-like films, such as *La Haine*. Comedy routines using local dialects. Locally-flavored video games like that one created for *Das Racist*? Zines written in a casual tone. Stories told and documented through rap verses. Locally-flavored anything: comic-books, photo essays, open-mics performances. ***Local arts.***

*La Haine* was one of my early favorite films. It being a cool, gritty, educational, anti-gangster gangster film perked the normative interests of my male-side, yet, it has many deep realities to it: going from suburban ‘projects’ to city urban planning; **everything from the point-of-view of real people**: institutionalized arts, police, malls, the ‘hood, and so on. It begins in a real place (the projects: banleaui[spelling?]) [with real people] and ends in a fake place (the city: Paris) [with fake people]. **From this point of view it’s all so clear.** From any other point of view though, it may not be so obvious, as Hollywood has proved: Sure, it’s clear to real people that any Hollywood movie, or any ***non-real art*, is just senseless, institutional ideas thrown together** [as pointed out by then obscured by Zizek], but, for many, I believe, that is not the case. So, **keeping a *real point-of-view* is pivotal**, I mean, without that, what is there really? Just **non-sensical ideas and traditions through history thrown together, much like reality.**

How do you capture the real?

**What is the real?** Is it natural? Un-tampered natural behaviors?

**How do you capture the real?** Video? Audio recording? **What the difference between those [documentary] mediums and arts such as poetry (rap and spoken word) prose (comedy)?** Condensation. Rap and spoken word break realities down to concepts and conceptual metaphors. It’s condensed and dense. Instead of a huge biography of a person who dies, a person may just be given one line. Isn’t the reality, then, lost? Yes. Yes, it is. That’s why documentaries are much closer to reality, even can be used as reference. **Video documentaries are a mirror of life. Most other arts are full of artifacts.**

**Then, doesn’t it just make sense to document reality?** Me in an extremely real state-of-mind would agree with this rationality. **It’s only through documentarians [and reality] that knowledge, especially of humans, can be derived.** Look at the world as Chris Marker’s camera strolls through it. Let Chris’s narration guide the mind, but, **it’s up to one’s own mind to really learn anything from it**. The other arts, especially language, are so far from reality. Hmmm...

But doesn’t Kendrick count? There’s so many ideas and *feelings* behind it. **The feelings and passion behind spoken word and music is...**something. “These Walls” has many ideas, and GKMC has many stories, but, there’s so much feeling on most of the tracks from TPAB. It’s **raw passion, coming solely from the voice**. That expression is quite different from video. Acting can show that kind of passion. As can dancing. But just documentary style video...is different. **In documentary style videos the real expressions of people are shown by the every-day actions of people. In many other arts, let’s say *expressive arts*, the expressions are expressed toward the medium in a more direct manner.** [It’s not real...as in, no one normally bursts out rapping “DNA”, but, the feelings and sentiments are true.] **The artist’s feelings are directly conveyed. It’s a very dense expression of that conveyance.** It’s about the artist’s feelings. **Documentary video is less egotistic, requiring far more attention and focus to really learn about reality [and how it works]. It can be an emotional experience, but not so directly from the artist, rather, from the realities of the world.** Watching chickens get crushed in Food Inc. is an emotional experience, but, it’s not directly expressed by the directory doing it: reality does it.

...So then, how does Kendrick fit my whole idea of keeping it real? How does Kendrick, by making rap, help keep and even make society behave more real? Well, he threw out political correctness immediately. ‘PC’ is the opposite of real [todo: another essay]. **He just makes the right judgements.** **He says what black is by expressing what black feels like by expressing how he felt [in several instances] in his past.** **And in doing so, by admitting his feelings, ‘putting it into wax’, he keeps it real.** The feelings he felt are felt by many others. It resonates. **Instead of conforming to institutions, he preserves black culture, for himself, and in doing so, for everyone.** **Simply admitting feelings, antagonisms, what one feels is wrong, what one feels passionate or emotional about, are ways of keeping it real.** [todo: make arts using this as the premise!!!]

Just tell the truth. Be truthful about one’s own feelings. Put it into art. That’s enough.

[todo: make a TPAB-like passionate album about the antagonisms of institutions]
