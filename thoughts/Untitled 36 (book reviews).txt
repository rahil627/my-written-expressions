# Tiqqun - Problem of the Head
I’m guessing this is some crazy contemporary “avant-garde” group. The topic is good, history of avant-garde groups like Situationist, Surrealism, etc., like themselves. But the content is ugh. It says a lot of dense things with surely much meaning, but, ugh, I’m just not in the mood. One would have to be in a city schizophrenic mood. “Conclusion: the problem is not the head, it is in the paralysis of he body; the act.” Basically that all these avant-garde people do is think but not practice or act, including themselves! [todo: trash the book, too much historical stuff, references, citing, etc. Rare 1/5?]

# Tiqqun - The Cybernetic Hypothesis
I only skimmed through. Much more readable than The Problem of the Head. Quite alright. Still not feeling it too much. But yea, the chapter with Capital (VI) seems alright.

## highlights
“Communication is the fundamental ‘third way’ of imperial control... Contemporary communications systems are not subordinate to sovereignty; on the contrary, it is sovereignty that appears to be subordinate to communications... Communication is the form of capitalist production in which capital has succeeded in entirely and globally subjugating society to its regime, suppressing all the possible ways of replacing it.”
Michael Hardt & Toni Negri, Empire, 1999

“Capital measures all value by labor time, while simultaneously diminishing it because of the productivity gains granted it by automation.”

# Tiqqun - How it is to be done
Haha. I’m quite fond of these kinds of creative, conceptual, pro-chaotic, pro-high-awareness writings. You know, one Laozi would approve of. Lots of good ideas packed in it. It’s usually written by a certain special personality, but, it could have been written by any very active, fluxus mind. When I write poetry, it’s often like this too, very conceptual, so, it’s quite interesting to see someone else do it.

It basically strives to maintain subjectivity, avoiding judgement / categorization / normalization, using this subjectivity as one’s weapon, to strike against those that do, until an insurrection builds.

Subjectivity, becoming, being are key. It finds its self in communal areas, able to breathe, live.

It begs us to come together, live truly, act truly. It’s been 20 years since the last time we did. [so it was written in ‘97?]

It gets lost with emotions most of the way. It criticizes fake anarchists, critical theorists, along with the entirety of Empire.

Yep, that’s the fiercely *utopian state of mind*. Begging for more true life and critiquing and rebelling against everything else. I’ve been there for long periods of time...

It’s really great that this state of mind is recorded. **There needs to be more documentation of it. All of the intense truths of the intense true life come from it.**
 [todo: can keep it. 4/5]

# Tiqqun - The Call
These sort of pamphlets are much more fun than the books. **This is just a general call for organizing, I believe, which is, perhaps the best thing one can write about, because it’s practical.** One highlight: **critique is useless. We already know that Empire (the system) is terrible. There is no need to critique it.** But, still talkative. Still, maybe written by an American? I also let it flow for a while, but, I’m just not in the mood. Maybe I’m not active at the moment... [todo: keep it. At least it’s written more artistically.!]

# Tiqqun - The Coming Insurrection
I guess written during a French riot at the ‘Assembly’? After the Greek riots? Still, like The Call, this is a good pamphlet. It makes sense. It’s emotional. It’s intuitive. There’s insights into why the riots are happening; ways to describe the reasons. [todo: keep it.]

# Tiqqun - Bloom Theory
This is a compilation of several writings, much like the SI anthology, but far more emphasis on human condition, rather than anything practical. SI cover a lot more: urban planning, art, methods to change peoples’ behaviors, political hurdles within communes, and so on. Tiqqun just emotes, like emo kids.

# Tiqqun - This is Not a Program
Another compilation of writings, perhaps like Bloom Theory. Passionate. Nice to have. Hopefully not as unreadable as *The Problem of the Head*.

# Benjamin Kunkel - Utopia or Bust
This book isn’t about utopia. It’s not even an attempt to express one’s original self. It’s just one guy providing book reviews and summaries of the works of a bunch of well selected, contemporary critical thinkers (Harvey, Jameson, Graeber, etc.). I breezed (skimmed) through it easily, as I didn’t care for it much. What’s puzzling is that he says nothing about utopia. All he says about utopia is that Zizek said nothing about utopia. Great! *Rates it 1 star.* Please re-title to ‘Brief reviews of 5 contemporary critical writers’. I was hoping for selected essays about utopia. :( [todo: trash it. “Not interested” in Goodreads.]

# Negri, Hardt - Declaration
Still too talkative. Starts well, following the Arab Spring. Saying that each protest was local with unique local demands, but then, ugh. [todo: yeah just trash it. “Not interested” in Goodreads.]

# Reausseu - Reveries of a Solitary Walker
Again, extremely talkative. Perhaps the most talkative, holy shit. How is it even possible to think that much during one walk? Anyway, the content is quite spread out, with some great insights, like, not worrying about people leads to a peace of mind, gift / debt / relationship in two paragraphs, then another on telling lies vs telling truths. But, it’s really auto-biographical, lots of digressions. I was almost going to trash it until I saw the relationship and lying part.

# Noam Chomsky - How The World Works
As always, warm, sane, practical, simple, real, current. Just do it attitude. That’s the best. That actually reflects my own personality. Forget those other crazed philosophers. He is the only one who’s really in tune with the world. The others are just passionate, stirred by emotions. Noam remains optimistic, positive. He still sees infinite possibilities. Perhaps he could even be a role model I should strive for. Just do the work, practically. Organize.

The difficult thing is there are no people.

# Marazzi - The Violence of Financial Capitalism
A very lucid, even readable (for something so fucking boring), summary of the 2007 financial crisis. (I guess I’ll keep it just because it’s a good book, even though I don’t care about the topic.)

# Leslie Holmes - Communism (part of the ‘A Very Short Introduction to...’ series by Oxford Book)
**This book is absolutely part of the system. It accomplishes to be a part of the system by saying nothing; It just bull-shits it’s way through by stating political events like policies, with a nearly complete “political”-determinism.** *Good job* Oxford. Way to maintain lies into the 2000s!

Other-wise, this is written quite straight-forward, like a Wikipedia article, but, just like Wikipedia, it just offers glances and briefs. So, one has to read it carefully, as it doesn’t explicitly say anything useful; Zero social, human feelings or reality here. Just straight institutionalized education, like a political history book from high school. It covers “communism”, which is, the bureaucratic socialist states claiming to be communist during the 1900s. It glances at the basic “theories” (mostly “political” policies) of Marx, Lenin, and Mao in the beginning to prep for the next largest section: a brief history of the socialist states. (todo: can trash after saving my highlights and annotations.)

**Given that this entire series is published by Oxford, it might be a safer choice to use Wikipedia for any of the books / topics in the series that contains humans.**

Anyway, if you’re interested in the topic of the socialist countries of that period of time, one of the easiest reads is in some of the chapters of Alexander Berkman’s ABCs to Anarchy (at least anarchists don’t hide their intentions!). Other-wise, you’d probably have to find some real documenter or social historian for each country that did the hard work of gathering real sources.

# Murray Bookchin - Post-Scarcity Anarchism
Murray doesn’t add anything new... He just states the obvious in a very academic way: What the 60s means for America. What is different from revolutions now and before, given the current state of developments (before people fought for bread, now for liberation of life; hence, post-scarcity). He gives a bit of re-assurance to mass protesters, saying that mass protest to the streets is the natural impulse, even if mob-like, that leads to individuation. He re-assures hippies in general. He adds a bit of ecology awareness into the argument. But, he does all of this really really dryly, without passion, without originality. The only cool thing is that none of it has become out-dated: “Black is Beautiful” is back at full-strength, and, indeed, the classes in power can’t do much about it, as capitalism runs society, more so than state order.

# Negri and Hardt - Empire
Uh. lol. Well...This is actually somewhat readable [at that moment for me] (compared to French ‘avant-garde’), but the problem is that it doesn’t say anything. It says what’s obvious, that the state systems is now one global system: ‘Empire’—my friend has a cat that could have told you that. It vaguely describes it [Empire] in the preface, then vaguely describes the people against it in the middle (‘against-it’s’—I’m serious, that’s the simple title they give rad rebels, nomads, outcasts, etc.), then ends it with the most cringe childish nature hippie love statement. It throws in Wikipedia facts about [past] political events (wobblies, past revolutions, etc.). It throws in some stuffy French stuff, with the standardized quote of one or two people at the beginning of each chapter (again, the French critical writers and ‘avant-gardes’). That’s it. Curtains close. Best-seller. Voila! This commodity happily sold to you by *the president and fellows of Harvard*. I shit you not. lolol. Ohhhh those good fellows... (Please do not pay Harvard to buy this shit.)

Well, okay, that was what I got from skimming it anyway. A very vague, detached feeling to it all. It just leaves me wondering if any of these sorts of people [post-political theorists?] do anything other than read and write these sorts of things... It doesn’t feel like they’ve ever had spent time in a shared living situation, with a group of friends, with family, with kids...let alone a commune or even individual arts and communal / anarchy projects (like re-using food-waste, feeding the homeless, etc.). Life is just impersonal politics to them. You know, the Federalists wrote the constitution...blah blah blah, enter random political fact here and there, enter random clever historical tid-bit. They can never conceive utopia because they never lived. They don’t even know what politics is because they never had an intimate personal relationship with a personality different from their own.

Anyway, for some real wisdom, the best I’ve seen is Ivan Illich...but you need to read that shit in isolation, like a monk. That’s the path to some real enlightenment. Otherwise, stick to the standard Berkman’s *What is Anarchism?* type stuff for general info or the ‘avant-garde’ artists that actually lived and practiced it (the SI, for example) to have some guides as you struggle to organize your own commune. Think clearly, and live love life; Fuck all this other shit. It’s just distracting junk that Harvard happily sells (probably because the book doesn’t focus on the uselessness of institutionalized education). Thus stealing the cars of the president and fellows of Harvard becomes one of the best counter-measures to take.

# The Zeitgeist Movement (TZM)
[Note: only read preface, last chapter, and one random chapter, little skimming.]
Pretty spot on and simple in some places, like the stupidity of the economy and the development of institutions (in that one very brief human history of institutionalization / ‘development’)...Very straight-forward no non-sense style writing, like an American high school kid writing a science paper: full of references of stats from the web. For the overall project’s directions, however, it’s a vague dream, like all solely-political-focused utopian fledglings that can only *dream* of a better future because they lack real communal experiences (traditional and family experiences too). It quickly skims over a lot of facts—the stats kind and the real intuitive kind—and ideas. As a result, there’s no details of real experiences, why a mind or culture would behave in this way, etc; No details on how humans work nor how utopia works. Theres also no personal experiences or feelings. It’s missing a whole cultural aspect (discarding it as “ideology”-centered as opposed to its simple “science”) and mostly focuses on economy.

Near the end, it’s extremely optimistic, planned / designed utopia like the Jetsons, as if all humans behave like good suburban robots. Despite all of that, some-times it’s nice to read though, as a contrast to the deeper readings. For example, just saying that the world is in debt of trillions of dollars, and showing the figures, really shows how silly the world is, and makes one worry less. It’s too quantitative at times, with a very American ideology, quite like reading Wikipedia [English articles]. It’s written in a very casual way, like a dreamer. Yeah...it’s *really* American. It feels like it was written from a person who lived in a suburban home [in America] and never left. It doesn’t have deep insights (psychology, ideology, cultural anthropology, etc.), but it’s insights not wrong either: it still correctly blames development / insitutions / economic system, etc. So, it becomes quite alright! It’s actually pretty cool for just some big picture stuff, casual reading (I mean, casual for street philosophers). It serves me quite a relief from reading way more dense critical philosophies. Having just skimmed Empire (the book) before this, I’d say they cover very similar ground, but in extremely different ways. Reading this feels like a breeze in comparison: more humble, light, happier (just sees how silly the systems are, as opposed having deep emotions of the suffering they cause), future-oriented, and free (and not sold by elite state-approved ‘schools’). Yeah, I’ll skim through it all one day.

# Raoul Vanageim - The Revolution of Everyday Life
After the SI anthology, this might be one of the best set of writings, and, all that by a single individual! Holy moly! And his name is similar to mine. Double holy moly!

This is how one should write. Trash all of that academic shit. Poetic righteousness. Personal. Real.

This is pure, direct, not overly complex or overly conceptual or too deep into philosophy; In avoiding all of that, it maintains coherence. It focuses on human condition, the system, and freeing one’s self from the system. What else could one ask for? That’s the most important topic of man-kind: taking back life.

...phew. It’s such a relief to be able to find a sane person in this world. After all of those fucking obscure “political” philosophy books out there. Ugh! Fucking shit. Obscuring everything. I just have to remember to keep the SI as my bible from now on. This marks the end of this short, one week reading period. No more books for another 5 years. :)

# What is Anarchism? by Alexander Berkman
This is one of those great books that are written plainly, directly, and humbly about a topic whose adherents are characteristically the opposite: complex, indirect, and pretentious.

If anarchism is *the ideal society*, then, making *the idea* more accessible is one of the most valuable endeavors a human can take.

Unfortunately, much of the world will still fail to understand, let alone join, by sharing and caring for others. The problem doesn’t lie with the book. It lies in the fact that arts and media fail to alter the behavior of humans. So, then, how to alter people without force?…

Aware of that, I still will personally attempt a few artful re-takes on this project’s concept in various forms of art throughout my life. Some-times even anarchists get tired of organizing reality. At least we can organize art in our down-time. :)

[5/5]

# The Conquest of Bread by Peter Kropotkin

# De-Schooling Society by Ivan Illich
topics: why and how to de-institutionalize society; some directions, ideas, and concepts for more humane institutions; the civilization / institutionalization trap

The most important, clear, coherent book that I know of on the toughest topic: what is wrong with the world, and how can we fix it?
[5/5]
 
# Essays... by Graeber
Graeber’s essays and writing style are extremely long-winded. Interesting for many, surely far more interesting than most historians or anthropologists or any academic person, but, still, perhaps too talkative. Still, he shares characteristics of people manufactured by the University of Chicago: a good, straight-forward writing style, even if it’s the length of a graduate paper. I’d probably never have slogged through the few that I did if I hadn’t lived in shack without electricity for some time the moment that I did...

It seems Graeber is interested in the right things though: the things we are all interested about: in-equality, freedom, changing the structure of the world, providing new structures, and so on. But, it’s curtained behind a vast amount of information of books, and further-more, he him-self is quite detached from his topics, providing nearly zero personal or real life experiences. Basically, he’s an anarchist that has lived his life in libraries and other similar shelters his entire life in New York. And thus, naturally, he’s doing anarchist work through academic methods: tracing the origins of human problems: our conceptions of the world, our cultures, our institutions, but, all through the books of dead white people, which is really strange to me, as I thought anthropologists experience living in various cultures, *then* write [based on those experiences].

Well, some-times. Some-times he’s doing god’s work, but most of the time, especially apparent in the first two essays, he’s just getting lost it in all, wasting time informing us that academic conceptions are skewed [as if being an academic didn’t imply that].

Anyway, it’s interesting to see the mind behind and before Debt, especially as a person that didn’t go to a well-read school, and more particularly, as a person who has the capability to write a tiny essay or some new concepts or lens (ways of seeing the world) but not much interested in writing anything beyond that. I thought by reading his essays that I could compare my own mind with his. I couldn’t. His mind is full of books. My mind is full of experiences and intentions. It seems we are two different animals. And I’m really really really happy about that. As after reading these two and a half essays, I would never ever want to attempt to write such things. So, for this reason, I’m glad to have read a bit. And another thing to be glad about: that I never went to such schools to force me to write in such things in such ways.

Otherwise, these essays are surely the beginnings of many of his other books  and books to come: direct action, democracy, authority, manners, consumerism, ‘n so on. As a person in it for the ideas ‘n concepts, these essays are probably a better place than those giant books!

I just can’t imagine it being read-able to anyone of this age... unless you too live in a library, or spent most of your life in school (which is probable), or am an ascetic—like me! My guess is the concepts and a few ideas from Debt is all I really wanted from Graeber. And that’s really good to know now, to *realize* that! That, **I don’t need to write like Graeber (or any academic), as I my-self don’t get any value from it. Providing the concepts is satisfying enough.** Then one can immediately go back into the world, with a new set a concepts freshly in the mind. Leave the lengthy arguments to those that like to enjoy arguing, rather than living.

Note: It’s possible believe I started out badly by just reading the first two. I should have read the anthropological ones on authority... Now that’s a useful topic I’m really interested in! One day I’ll get to it.

# Debt... by Graeber
The idea behind this project is incredible. To first conceptualize trace money to debt, and continue to conceptualize all of the relations related to debt, mainly exchange relations, and particularly, gift-exchange relations. Then, to see the exchange relations, conceptions of debt / money, and morals related to debt / money, and dispositions towards debt / accumulation / ‘n so on, through different cultures in different times.

Again, as with his essays, he uses dead academicians for most of his knowledge. There is little to no personal or real experience. Furthermore, those academicians are philosophers, political, and economical writers. So, if one were to read about the debt relations through the Axial Age (an extremely interesting project), it’s not some insight gleaned entirely from imagining what that life entails (something social historians do), but, rather, likely something gleaned from some academic-pop from Confucius, Vedics, Mohammad, or some Roman Catholic leader. Which, makes it fun in a quirky way, but, rather lacking in surely important details of life. (Maybe he expects us to have a good imagination of historical times?)

Again, as with his essays, he is extremely detached from the life going on, culturally, physically, mentally, survival (diseases), various ethics, various beliefs, ‘n so on. In one way, sure, one has to scope into the topic, but, to me, it takes away from the rest of things that constitute life. (So, perhaps he him-self doesn’t have a good imagination of what life, or, the minds of of the lives were like within the periods of times he surveys. I mean, no on does anyway... Or, more likely, his personality really is more narrowly conceptual than holistic. He can’t really paint a picture of what being in India (living; relationship with a neighbor, relationship with a market-place, ‘n so on) is like with words. So, there’s no way for him to paint an ancient India. Thus, there’s absolutely no way for him to paint of the picture of India that an ancient Indian would paint.)

As with any history, it’s hard to even digest a single sentence, as human history is so absurd, contradictory, and cruel.

But, it’s still magnificent. For anyone who walks around the world seeing people in chains, bondages, contracts, markets, commodities...anyone that has even thought of seeking the origin of capitalism, or whatever the heck that even means, or how it’s come to this... I think this is it. **This is the book to begin with. The book to start with for one’s own research into how today’s relationships between humans became so inhumane, money-oriented, market-oriented.** How people could treat others like clerks or waiters, or most importantly, like others (instead of, you know, one’s own family.), or, even do those jobs to begin with.

And, he does all of that in a somewhat read-able and fun way (even if it’s full of academic references, problems exclusive to that narrow academic world or worse: the extremely narrow economist world, political history...well, it’s still great)!

# Eros and Civilization by Herbert Marcuse
topic: institutionalization of the individual and society

“The subsequent discussion will be focused on this hidden trend in psychoanalysis.
Freud’ s analysis of the development of the repressive mental apparatus proceeds on two levels: (a) Ontogenetic: the growth of the repressed individual from early infancy to his conscious societal existence.
(b) Phylogenetic: the growth of repressive civilization from the primal horde to the fully constituted civilized state.
The two levels are continually interrelated. This interrelation is epitomized in Freud’s notion of the return of the repressed in history: the individual re-experiences and reenacts the great traumatic events in the development of the genus, and the instinctual dynamic reflects throughout the conflict between individual and genus (between particular and universal) as well as the various solutions of this conflict.”
