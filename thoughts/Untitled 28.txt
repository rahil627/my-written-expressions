## anarchy tools
### positive anarchy tools
food waste mapping tool
  - crowd-sourced
  - local food waste mapping project (Taiwan CF)
    - can call and ask buffets and restaurants for food waste
  - global mapping by importing geo-points from other sources
  - cooked and uncooked, farmer’s produce waste
  - special food waste that can be used for animals—home and farm animals
homeless mapping tool
  - crowd-sourced
  - local homeless mapping project (Taiwan CF)
  - places that provide: free meals, free water, free shelters, free bicycles, free essentials, free showers (public places too!), free (and clean!) toilets
      - this idea overlaps data with traveling without accommodation (free showers)
  - this could lead to finding places more suitable for homeless people to live. A place where water, food, and shelter come easy, along with access to the city (and therefore wage labor and people)
environment cleaning mapping tool
  - crowd-sourced
  - **local environment cleaning project (Taiwan CF)**
    - sunset island: the beach and tree-line
      - just try!
      - $1000NT per day of work, a sort of funding
        - pay ALiang the most
second-hand shop map
  - crowd-sourced
  - national mapping project (Taiwan CF)
  - include flea markets (not shops, but actual out-door markets)
  - mostly done online now... (links to popular online markets, global and national)
up-cycle mapping
  - mapping useless materials
  - overlaps with material mapping
  - good for up-cycle projects and material-based creativity
  - also way for trading business: buy nationally, sell globally. Especially electronics, such as Apple.

**Spots (public and free marketing spaces)**
  - mapping app, with crowd-sourced info, similar to Yelp
    - have to choose between Google Maps or a separate Yelp-like platform. Need to see if Google Maps provides the ability to add fields such as:
  - places to vend or busk
  - police-friendly?
  - neighbor-friendly?
  - space for truck, car, motorcycle, bicycle?
  - music-friendly?

Slack channels for each project? At least some way for the crowd to communicate with each other in a human way...Perhaps leading to a community of its own.

World-wide maps. Just a custom map on top of Google Maps.

site mapping / domain paths
maps.tools.waywardwolf.com
maps.anarchy.tools.waywardwolf.com
  - sub-domains for completely new sites
waywardwolf.com/tools/anarchy/maps
  - slash for using the same site (whatever CMS I choose)
  - can add sub-domain re-direct as a shortcut, informing people of it on the page

writings.waywardwolf.com
  - new site, using an auto-gen CMS
  - alt: philosophy, writings, notepad, notebooks, notes
  - auto-gen complete list of files
  - include section for notes (specific knowledge, etc.)
  - philosophy, essays, thoughts, notes
    - separate notes (documentation) from philosophy [and writings], especially those not related to anarchy [or humans]
    - one part should be philosophy, in a strict first principles sense. Then, the main part can be the rest of the writings—essays, thoughts, ideas, concepts, cultural observations, etc.
      - categorize entries by type. Concept can be a pholosophical first principles concept.

photos.waywardwolf.com & /photos
  - some sort of web-app for photos, or, use the CMS to use posts as albums
  - photo series such as the Humans project can also be done via CMS
    - can check Vincent Moon and Humans of NY. I believe HoNY used Tumblr. Locally install Tumblr? I think Kirby can be used for posting any sort of media and commenting... just have to provide and embed a Slack channel.
  - I think what I like is having control, having everything on my server, not on other sites or web apps. Not Facebook, not Instagram, none of it. Just my own site with everything I own. Social networks must link to me, not to itself.
    - Thus, no photos shall be uploaded to Facebook, but, there can be a fan page that links to my site.

music.waywardwolf.com & /music
  - my own music?
  - link to music.txt

films.waywardwolf.com
  - list of films, embed Vimeo / YouTube vs just putting it straight on the server
  - link to film notes

games.waywardwolf.com
  - list of games, game prototypes, game ideas
  - link to game notes

I think I need two CMSs: one for my writings, auto-gen’d, and one for the rest, a simple one (Kirby)
  - so, anyway, have to migrate to Kirby

some way to embed the Slack channel into the web-site?
  - the web-page would consist of links to Google Maps, embedded maps, embedded Slack chat room

photos of DIY gadgets / ideas
  - cool tools continuation
  - crowd-sourced, crowd-rated
  - can lead to industrializing via 3D-printing

## anti-fake media
### real internet
[anti-pop media]
add-ons to block the use unconscious consumption of fake media: Facebook, Instagram (public), YouTube, Twitter, everything. Simple quotes to remind people of reality. Or, pictures of streets and homes around the world. Simple sounds to direct one’s attention away from it all. Nature sounds. Chimes. Bells. Slow music, without the beat of a working slave.

Block Google news.

browser add-ons to replace pictures with pictures of reality: somewhat evenly divided across cultures. So, for example, many South Asians, Chinese, Africans, etc.

browser add-ons to detect anything owned by a large corporation, not just ads, but, media, web-sites, even servers, the building of the internet! lol. Replace those pictures and links with the names of corporations.



# real projects
## commune-making
### sunset island commune
This comes first, simply because I live here. But, I must get out, because the culture surrounding it is terrible. Also, it’s on the developed side of Taiwan.

Just do the repairs, create a communal place for surfers, but, don’t get in too deep.

Test hippie businesses: sell tea (experiment a few kinds), sell food (experiment a few kinds), figure out bicycles, figure out pottery[?], busk. Can try pay-what-you-want models for all three.
 - coincides with Spots idea
   - have to do and build technology concurrently
 - coincides with DIT idea

Provide CouchSurfing hosting! Try other hospitality sites too. (Not work exchange! Real, free exchange.)
  - This could lead to making the space more homely: renovating, painting, natural stove building, etc.

### east side commune
This is the dream.

First, I need to find a place. Should it be property or on nature? Or, can I negotiate with tribes?

It’s difficult to build up a commune if one does not own the property, as the state can always take it down, as it is not legal, giving them the right to force...

But, even if it were legally owned, the state could take it down. The laws don’t matter...

Hmmm...

Anyway.

It should be within distance to a good [physical] market. Perhaps, the best market in the area. That is, the city. Traveling 50 kilometers to get to the market is quite the waste, of gas, time, and human energy, and, it’s a bore, a commute.

Sunset island works by having the market right there, on the island. People physically come. The market is within viewing distance, like having a vending stall in front of one’s house. It’s perfect.

I guess on the east side I can get an electric scooter to do the commute. It might be okay... Still a waste though.

**Perhaps one must migrate. Migrate to the city when one needs the market. Migrate to the east side when one has enough money stored. Yeah. That’s best. Separate the market from home.** This way there are no useless commutes. No wasting time in markets. Just do it all quickly in a short period of time. Just have to create wares and sell it all.

This makes selling daily things like food and drinks impossible. Well, it’s not natural anyway. Have to make and sell store-able foods and drinks (alcohol!).
—

Practically, I should take a motorcycle trip. First, just find a nice place to pitch a tent, perhaps not too far from a public bathroom. Then, just check property web-site once. Then, wander around, looking for good people. Network. Ask around for homes. Especially the hippies that live in Dulan, and, the people that vend at metal flower street. Through them, keep searching, until, one find a place and/or people. Also, take regular trips to tribes. Try to find a few nice waterfalls.

At the moment, I’m thinking a Totoro house near farms is much better than a hippie enclave. Just be completely independent. Because, even the hippies are stupid, just a strand of the public. Complete independence, and, a Factory-like public commune. I do not want to take care of the stupid public. At the public commune, I can tolerate them, but have zero responsibility to clean their shit up. Just go, do my work, get out.

### Taibei commune?
Perhaps just a space in nature to pitch a tent or park a car, to take advantage of the markets.

**A city commune would be nice though. It would have the largest amount of people participating. The most amount of artists. The most diverse. The most accessible.** It would just have to be somewhere in nature, or an abandoned building, as property costs too much. Or a deal with a moral land-lord.

Still, a very very worthy thing to do. **Maybe even the best thing to do, as it would effect the greatest amount of people.**

## hippie-business-making (communal-capitalist)

tea, herbal tea, coffee
  - self-serving (drink [including sugar, milk] payment)

    - 2. chai masala?

### food
food-stand vs at the commune pay-what-you-want
  - food-stand, to separate the market from the commune
    - first at sunset island, but then, can also try selling at other locations, such as night markets and train stations. Rural train stations would be a great place to try.
  - self serving (food [including salt] and payment)

Get from fishing area. Sell at the sunset island commune.

### motorcycles
selling online (nationally)
