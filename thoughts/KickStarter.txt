(I got most of this info from the KS FAQs)

## formatting
all caps headers?
Because the KS text editor sucks, one has to re-add all text formatting (bold, italics, headers, links, photos, etc.). To make up for this, can create a list of links or place them below each corresponding paragraph, copy-paste by sections.
For larger projects, can separate it to a core and full proposal on my web-site.

## marketing
Personally e-mail other artists, fuck the press. They are not my audience. List artists. Prep e-mails. Send (“blast”) all when I launch the project.

# biography
I’m a life-long diarist, philosopher, anarchist (utopianist and rebel), designer, communal-place-maker, and, with the help of Kickstarter, a life-long film-maker, game-maker, music-maker, civil technologist too!

Yo. When I’m a human, I usually just volunteer for dreamers, playfully working together to build and maintain utopian places.

Rawr. When I’m a wolf, I seriously art reality, then implement tools and ideas to guide the sheep into the moral light.
