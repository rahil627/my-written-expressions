save the lyrics of some of the best verses in hip-hop to Dropbox
  - Inspectah Deck, relisten to Wu-Tang albums, GZA, Masta Killa, etc. AZ verse, Jay Rock’s flow on Money Trees, J Cole flow?, relisten to 2pac, Capital STEEZ, 1999 by Joey, Bones Thugs and Harmony?, Ghostface and Raekwon visual / descriptive, Hydeout Productions, DOOM, Kendrick (everything)
also can try some of the best spoken word, including favorites, such as Mojghani, or ones that feel more like hip-hop such as Saul and that one older dude
can try to take some characteristics from battle rap too: “slow it down”, DNA, dumbfounded, punch-lines, etc.
 do a little comparative analysis, see what I like and feel sound good, much in the way I know what particular sounds (instrument, notes, composition) sounds good in the anime music playlist.
 
 then, write.
 
 content comes first?
 then the concepts come
 
 i really wish I had my philosophy notebooks for this...
 
 For the moment, can use thoughts.txt or Voice Dream highlights, and, finding old thoughts to develop, as opposed to written essays, **can use rap to write essays.**
 
 In this way, my essays will have the same content, but, just a lyrics structure.
 
 The music can still be the simple Nujabes like tunes I’m into: simple instruments and melodies.
 
 How it all comes together, the pacing, n all, is part of the album-creating process.
 
 I believe the lyrical content should come first, then fit the music around it.
 
 ...
 
other possible topics: daily life / thoughts, **ways to change / better the world** (much like 2pac’s changes, but with more practical rebellious activities), **feelings**: feelings towards people in Taiwan (fake people, West Coast too), toward captailism, living with zombies, creativity, ideas, inability to actualize them, institutions, etc.

...

changes to concepts of the mind toward a more classist and opressed awareness...

yeah, **rap is just another expression, as film essays are. What happened was that I was consuming rap, and, as a causal effect, my mind structured content in a similar way, thus, altering my expression towards rap.**

no. It feels wrong. It feels wrong to use old thoughts to express myself. I can only express myself at the present moment, whatever feelings I have now.

Thus, in order to create, I must be living, consciously, doing what I feel is right, then, at some moment, express it in rap form, recording the audio, as repeating it would be fake.

# philosophy of rap (and hip-hop)
## 1
an oral tradition, emphasis on orality, listened never read

this oral emphasis makes the rap canon more about memorable lines, albums, etc. One remembers the AZ and Triumph verses. One also remembers the feelings of certain tracks and albums: the dark coke rap of the Clipse and Ghost and Rae, the perseverance of Kanye (the wire, jesus walks), Eminem, and most popular figures. The feeling music polished into Kendrick’s DAMN, but also anyone: Kanye’s Life of Pablo, ASAP Rocky, Vince Staples, Run The Jewels, Chance (has music for a smoke break and a juke jam) etc. to provide some energy to dance and power through the day. All have different purposes.

Jay-Z’s verses and lines are also so domineering and memorable they become vocabulary: can I live?, ‘we hate a nigga for lovin’ this life’, dead presidents (Nas), CREAM (Wu-Tang clan), etc.

Thus, it becomes more about finding times in life to rap about, certain feelings, and turning that feeling into a song. The feeling, ‘can I live?’ being about just being able to live as a gangster turned rich black person, and ‘CREAM’ not merely about capitalism but about the feeling of being in a system that oppresses black people in certain areas, ‘life’s a bitch’ about just getting money to live happily and continue righteously aware that everyone is going to die, Vince Staples similarly conveys hopelessness and stoicism. **These are life’s songs.**

**“Songs that you can live with.”** **That’s why everyone remembers and replays those songs and verses. One can live with them.** **Life often is about living the ethics of ‘life’s a bitch’.** It’s also about partying to ‘swimming pools’, being in your ‘element’, feeling like ‘king kunta’; The last two quite empowering. **Thus, it can also be songs that aid you.**

Cardi B empowers females. Kendrick, through the mess of the institutions and Compton street life sticks to his real self, singing ‘it’s real’, knowing nothing around him is him but himself.

Fleet Foxes covers really particular feelings / states of minds too: wandered too far, time pass, loss of love (not death, just emotion), distance of relationship, helplessness, etc. These are really really strong emotions, conveyed more poetically, but still in rap-like verses. Radiohead’s In Rainbows, Moon-shaped Pool, and other classics on love are able to cover these feelings too.

Dream Pop allows me to contemplate, think, feel, without much care for lyrics, though they exist. The music itself is powerful enough to evoke emotions. The same goes for anime music.

**Rebel music is what I want to make. Teach anarchy to guide people, but rebel music to live by.** Surely time for thinking, contemplating should be there too.

The teaching part should be memorable like Jay-Z verses, creating a new culture, adding new vocabulary, phrases, and meanings. Thus **making anarchy the cool, hip, norm, just as hip-hop often glorifies gangster life, it should glorify anarchic life.** **Anarchy songs to live by.**

It can reference anarchists, writers and actual anarchists (Zapatistas, Occupy organizers, community organizers, people that help the homeless, etc.). Yeah, that’s much better than referencing anarchist writers. Organizations such as SI, or even ones I participated in can be referenced, to steer people toward great organizations, popularizing them.

Anarchist ideas and concepts can be turned into simpler, black-culture phrases... Philosophy ideas too [todo: tbc].

**Reject authority, stop working (wage-labour), empower-self, live simply, live slowly, etc. These are the songs to live by.**

## 1.3
Hip-hop can be referenced through sample, words (names), phrases, or even just cadence. It’s usually canonized this way, influences often referenced, as either a direct influence, response, or otherwise.

## 1.2
One studies a GZA album, but probably isn’t found dancing to it as one would to fade. To do both, as in TPAB, is rare. There needs to be space in the music for dancing and for studying; and other modes of living too: meditating, conscious thinking (perhaps live recording, every-day sounds), etc.

The result may be something more like TPAB, but with more music time and less verses. The verses need time to sink. Spoken word for the emotions, verses for the scripture-like knowledge, hooks to live with, music to chill and drift the imagination with.

The result may be something more like a Nujabes album, but with more cohesion, a single narrative direction, and music breaks in-between verses.

The musical instrumental sounds continue, but the drums may change or begin when a verse begins. Drums aren’t needed for spoken word. They also are not needed for contemplating music, as anime music doesn’t have them.

...

Live sounds would add a realistic depth to it, just as the skits and dialogs in GKMC do, taking one to Compton. **Natural sounds, traditional instruments, chanting, rituals, kids, all can move the imagination.** Sounds of nature also brings desire to be in / go to nature. Sounds of people, to the city. Sounds of kids, to humans. Foreign languages for a different culture feel, bringing awareness of different places in the world.

An ambience of each environment would be nice, to create a more live feel. Adding reality, liveliness.

**To a very conscious mind, a single sound can move the imagination to a memory: in nature, a certain instrument, vacation in rural areas, beach, mountains, city, etc. It can make one travel. Train sounds in-between.** Even emotional orchestrated music will move the imagination to natural places, as much of anime music does, at least, for me.

...

Listing to Nujabes, there’s definitely a pacing to it. Substantial fits that pace perfectly, along with Pase. Cise a little more uptempo. Apani, and much of the albums, about striving, persevering, getting by. **Shing02 with perhaps the best poetry, imagery, references to nature and concepts.** I don’t quite remember any of the verses, I just know that they’re generally uplifting, simple, and **flow with the music really well.** These aren’t lyrics to become conscious about, they’re just part of the music. Substantial’s are usually about love in the most humble manner, being most memorable and having the best hooks.

That pacing is quite similar to the slow pace of Faye Wong, and perhaps much of dream pop, but with Faye standing out much more.

...

Rap verses can reference anarchist-aligned art, like Studio Ghibli or that farm anime, if I want to, capturing that sort of audience, and exposing it. Otherwise, references should all be real, or, just mention blue-collar workers.

... (thoughts on this a few days later)
Only 2pac makes one really sentimental. Others may have narrative, show struggle, educate, have clever wordplay, but 2pac is a musician first turned gangster. Even when provoking gangsters to come at him, he sounds soulful.

A hypothetical top 5 may look like: Wu-Tang Clan, Nujabes, Kanye (if including production and arrangement, and of Be and Blueprint), Kendrick, Jay-Z, 2pac, Ghostface, then perhaps even other members of the Clan (Inspectah Deck, GZA, Masta Killa, etc.). Artfully, the guy from Digable Planets / Shabazz Palaces, Del, DOOM may get spots.

# raps
(i used to believe in treating people equally, like a family
(i used to believe that I had to do what’s right)
i used to believe that every action I took mattered
i used to believe that what I did had an effect
i used to believe that people could learn
i used to believe that people could change
i used to believe in people
(i used to believe in beliefs)
i used to believe that
‘til I was broke
and no one would give me work
hundreds of fake people that can’t even say why not to my face

now you best believe that ima get this money
without work

and all those fake people
‘gonna get fucked up
 
these people ain’t my family
family doesn’t let its members starve, beg
family doesn’t give its members meals out of pity
family doesn’t leave its members without a home, a hot shower
family doesn’t treat family like animals
treat me like an animal? You gonna get fucked up.
 
That’s the only way they’ll learn
violence
 
you actually think non-violence can counter violence?
that’s an indoctrinated slave’s perspective
(only) violence counters violence

an’ all violence is violence
the structure [of if] doesn’t matter
 
Thats the only way people will learn: consistently react [to wrongs] with violence.
 
 ...
 
when someone does something wrong, threaten them
does it again? punch them
 
authority is necessary to right wrongs

...

but, when does one know one is right? and [therefore] when to use authority
towards anything that goes against basic human needs, that goes against safety, **that uses people**, that treats people unfairly:
driving without regard for traffic rules (and therefore traffic safety)
**anyone who has money but doesn’t share it to those that need it**
the owners (CEOs) of companies that use harmful chemicals
land-owners that enter the rented property without permission
people that throw trash, pee, trespass, park in private property
people that stare
**people that hold cultural beliefs (treating others based on cultural stereotypes)**
business owners that use females for their attractiveness (store-front, advertisement)
**business owners that use people for services (polite / fake behavior toward customers)**
...

what about environmental ethics (including animal)?
should people be punished / fought off for environmental offenses [violations]?
this, i believe, requires a bit more thought before using authority.

for example, maybe **people use motorcycles and convenient food and beverage in order to work to get money to survive. They can’t be punished for wanting to survive.** Further, if cultural environment is developed, and being environmentally unconscious is the norm, then is it right to punish? **Should people have a moral force from within, or should people be punished for it, because it is wrong for the environment. Punished, because people cannot be trusted to have morals (and obey them).**

**Punish anyone who isn’t trying to live a morally right life, except those that are doing wrongs [in order] to survive or to help others to survive.**

**Punish with priority:** Those that abuse the most amount of power should be higher. Petty beaourgosie should be of low priority? Both are doing wrong, but, one is doing wrong on a much larger scale. The amount of wrong can be calculated, in how many violations of morals per person (and per environmental cost). Thus, the owner of brothel should be punished before and more than the owner of a school that discriminates upon employment; And the owner of the school more than someone who doesn’t share their wealth.

**The owners should be punished,** not the employees, whom merely follow the owner’s rules, unless, it’s the employees (the manager) that violates.


### another rap thought
acting based on love and care is impossible when people aren’t free,
  further hindered without the amenities to maintain physical and mental homeostases.
  
without that minimal freedom, I have had to transform my mind to get money,
  to get my freedom back.
  
Now, habituated to merely survive cheaply and get money, I have I broke a few moral rules, and, my mind has been slowly numbing. There is almost no consciousness.

I hydrate, eat, sleep, look for work, think, day-dream, consume media, day-dream as reaction to media as opposed to the world. Day-dreams of rapping, getting out of this trap, community, having relations, etc.

I need to get the fuck out of this mess, and, money seems the only way out, and **I hate taking actions solely toward getting money. It’s not natural.** I just can’t do it. I want to be with people, do things with people.

###
songs for empowerment
songs for emancipation
songs toward a right direction (fuck tradition, state, capitalism, male power, etc.)
