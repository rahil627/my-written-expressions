I’ve got to keep going. Inform Taifeng tomorrow before eating, so that I can ask if I can store some things in his store-room. Also. how the heck will I fetch the bike without transportation to get back? I’ll need his help there too. Then, all is left is the bag, and tying it to the motorcycle. Then...what? Just inform all the Tainan peeps I’m looking for work? Not enough, and never worked in the past. I’ll have to go round asking again myself, which, is. ultimately really depressing. Then, what? Try the websites, and just keep calling people. Alienating, sure, but I have to, for a moment, until I can avoid alienation again, hopefully, forever.

The internet market seems to be the way to go, to avoid alienation and market comstraints. To live in nature. Growing, packing, selling vegetables would be silly. Digital art, digital exchange (skill, teaching). **Meh, even digital work seems alienating.** It’s not local. There’s nothing local about it. It’s just work for something out in the digital world. Most of my digital ideas involve putting locality *into* the digital world. **I always desire to work with the people around me. My neighbors.** Why is that so difficult?

Pay the bank tomorrow. Pay Taifeng / Andy via Paypal. Message Lok Yu. Message Harshita. Check e-mail from JV’s.
