Poverty has led me to live to a very subjective life: I do what I want. Every action is of my own doing. Nobody influences my actions.

Sure, poverty is disabling, but, as long as one has a home, access to water and food, it’s...something.

Yet, still, it’s not life.

Life, at least for my personality, is a constant exchange between humans. Consensus leads to concerted actions.

So, all of this anarchic talk about autonomy doesn’t work for my personality, simply because I don’t feel like doing anything without people. It’s the people that motivate, excite, enervate me.

Beginning alone is not the way.

Finding people was the way all along.

But one has to communicate to those people the desire to live right.

But there are so few [that reciprocate]...

I must use digital means to find them. Just one person is enough. Then, from there, life begins

A new society is created.

Anarchy is actualized.

It takes two to make anarchy.
