## another sheet
just be happy [written beside thoughts about getting money]

neo-tribalism
  - **[participate in ]multiple organizations, but independent [not wage labour, forced labour], choosing time [freely able to volunteer time for any organization, or, neo-tribe]**
  - **part-time work is freedom (+ food, house, etc. [material needs])**


## "at 藝文嘍, I think"
Playful, natural, but lacks creativity. No game design, music creativity, direction. Just human nature, like being at home, without socio-political motivations.

Or, perhaps it's me, only acting toward these things.

## 一片紙 (I think I tried to translate to Chinese, for practice)

knowledge of place - network - local / neighborhood
熟悉地方 - network - 當地／本地的地方 ／ 鄰居

  family  vs independent
  caring for irrational
  time and capitalism

家人的關係 對 獨立的關係
  －照顧不理的事情 對 時間跟資本主義
  
what is traditional?
  - attention to mundane
    - required for living (health, food, etc.), but shortened by industrialization    
  
  傳統是什麼？ （心裡）
    － 注意世事（活的事情）
      －為活必要，可是為讓活短了工業化
    －文化的，習慣的行為

leisure time as measure
有空閒是一種量

natural work vs money as extrinsic motive
  / not worth time, time is money
自然的工作 對 前是外在的動機
  / 不值時間，時間是錢

  －自然的音聲
  
**maintaining peace (and harmony)**
  - via nature and artificial (copied nature)

thoughts:
I would rather be at home than any kind of school. The home environment is freedom. All schools are terrible. Only ones with complete freedom are worthy. [The same goes for any kind of environment -- art residencies, etc.]

## motorcycle maintenance

### engine oil

#### check
stand motorcycle upright: on center stands versus posted up against a wall?
remove engine oil gauge, wipe clean, insert but don’t screw in, check gauge:
lower mark when cold, upper mark when hot


#### replace

recommend SAE 10W-40

## motorcycle repair

### can’t start?
spark plug
  - how to check if it’s bad?
  - clean crap with a wire brush (or old screwdriver)
  - replace
  - wet after start?
    - ?



## notes
use rag to clean inside areas, not wire brushes as they can scour insulating material
use water displacement fluid (WD-40) only when nuts are too tight (and rusty) to remove, otherwise, just use lube once the screw and nut are off
