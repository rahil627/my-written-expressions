Told to move out this morning by the fishing shop auntie. I felt so happy today that I did just that. I had extra sleep from last night. The perfect weather is continuing. So, I packed carefully and moved everything to the cleaning-uncle near the fishing pier. Now, feeling on the move, I’m at the beach, watching kite-surfers on the crescent bay.

I really am just that passive of a person. Most things really just don’t bother me. I just accept that most people are stupid, full of stupid habits. Dis-obeying people, I guess, depends on my mood, along with the situation. Some-times I obey. Some-times I can be more strict. There’s no telling. I used to tolerate a lot. Now I have none (tolerance).

A little work...might be enough...for this season. But what about the other, more passionate seasons? I’m not so sure...

I was reading some of the personality writings I had taken screenshots from before... So much of humans can be learned from it, without much experience. In fact, it may be impossible to get such information certian personalities themselves, as they suck in expressing themselves, unless, they’ve really really developed themselves.

I’ve spent much of my life treating others as equals. It’s wrong. It shouldn’t be inequal, but it should be very different. I’ve been running around passionately talking to anyone and everyone, when, according to personality theory, only one other personality really can (is able to) appreciate such thoughts...Well, is that true?

My homies from VA really appreciated me, being in the group. So did my NY homies. As did several other groups of peers. But...at that time, was I really expressing my deeper thoughts? Probably not. What [was] shown was my practical, direct, non-traditional, quiet, observant side, not my concepts, morals, ideas, ideals.

For those things, only a few, it seems (according to personality theory), can really appreciate them. Manly, other **idealists** (NPs: INFP, ENFP, INTP, ENTP; and, INFJ). Although all of those personalities **can live together, developing a set of ethics to follow, together, inspiring and motivating others by living it**,...only two really understand me *and* my thoughts: INFJ and myself. And, of the two, only one is really tolerable to spend long periods of time with: INFJ.

Where is she?

I’m disabled from even searching for her. The one time I desire her, I’m unable.

But, now [at and for the moment] that I’m far more passive, slow, unable-to-be-passionate, I know. Once I’m passionate again, being myself, will I need her?

Usually, just having social people around (a city) is enough to satisfy my social desires. A group of homies is better. A group of idealists even better. But, her...that must be something else.

To share everything with? How does that feel?

Is that what I want? Which social group is best? All of them. A partner, a commune, neighborhood homies, a city. One needs all of them to really develop as a good human being. Live in the city, participate in the commune (to live together, and to better living; learning together), hang-out and play with the nabe homies (real cultures, keeping it real), share everything with a partner (thoughts, ideals, rationality, observations, action-plans, validating each other, theories, and so on).

Seeing the beauty of an entire city is, or seems, important, as I felt much of my time in Taipei. To be blissful, happy, to be with humans...It sure does beat being in poverty, and facing against traditional peoples...and their discriminations and prejudices...

Man, I miss that feeling of dance-punk, of Anamanaguchi[?] neon pizza delivery in New York: dat funk.

God damn these fake Taiwan copies of Western music. Ugh.

Yeah, drinking and dancing [or just playing video games and hanging out] really is necessary, for just gelling together. To be close together, without worry. To be at comfort. Even just for a moment. In-between, or after spending a whole day over-working toward the commune, or, toward one’s own artful desires.

Ugh, this radio music is terrible. God-damn! That reminds me:

**Most Taiwanese people do seem to fit closer to the ENFP personality, sharing all of its negative traits: shallow progressive-ness, only caring about and seeing intentions as opposed to the real affects.** So, merely having a good heart is enough, rather, than actually helping people, enabling people, lifting people out of bad circumstances; **Much like most religious peoples at religious places of worship, spiritual peoples at hippie places of worship**, and, in the case of Taiwan, it seems, just most people. **This, I feel, gives off another discrete feeling of fake.**

It’s not politically correct-ness, well...some-times it is...but this fake, this...is something that really annoys me, as a realist. It’s a trait, no, rather, a common occurrence to ENFPs and even INFPs. It happens so often. **They simply don’t do anything practical.** INFPs might art, express their-selves, **live right, but they don’t take actions toward any of their ideas and dreams** [is it possible to live right without reaching for dreams? What are the differences between those two ethics? Perhaps both must be done simultaneously!]. ENFPs are worse, like innocent-Taiwanese or artsy protesters, though they have much feeling in their expressions, their innocent expressions are just that: Sun-flower protesters: no action, just expression, as expected from the idealist fairy children that they are. It’s a joke. It looks like a joke and really is one. All of them: The Place of Arts and The Factory: all fairies with minute expressions written on their bodies.

Thus, it really does seem that only people similar to me and INFJ are the only ones with the minds to plan well, complexly, and, actually follow-through. The others must simply follow-through with our extremely flexible plans. Those other weak idealists will never do anything practical, or even incept it, much like the children in Parson’s. It just doesn’t come naturally to them. Even beneath great minds, they may still not follow-through with plans, being too weak to take any real direct rebellious actions. They’ll sit and watch passively, or worse, take in the damage of existing authorities.

**Thus, the idealists being such weak fighters, will continue to lose. It’s only through art, media, technology, design, ideas to convert others, that the strengths to really over-throw authorities and institutions would really work.**

Thus, and hence, anarchists are rare. By anarchists, I mean, someone willing to do the negative work, to fight back. Not just dream, but to take actions. [Like a **vigilante**.] It really **is rare**.

Yet...there were so many people that attend and organize protests...But those are only protests, not really good, precise-hitting direct actions.

**It’s just us two. Anyone who joins, joins in solidarity.** They will not know what they’re doing, but, like a good sheep with good intentions, they’ll participate where they can. And, that’s really all one can ask for, without forcing people to join / participate.

**Everything starts with us, from within. Actions. Plans.** It’s just a matter of being public with it to attract others to participate in the actions. Yet, even without them, we continue our programme, knowingly right, with much wisdom between us. Me, the lone rebel, her, the strategist keeping post at the offensive-base.

Forget about those INFPs and ENFPs that have organized their own cute organizations. We have to begin our own action-oriented programme. **Having an INFP or ENFP at the helm is a near-waste. A good place to grow up, sure, ideal even**, but ultimately not a good place, because it will eventually fall to the bad behaviors of the ruling authorities. They’re places for children, not places for adults.

Once one enters the adult way of life, one has to deal with bad behaviors of others, not just one’s own good place. One has to keep it real. One has to call out, stop, and even attack other people from performing bad behaviors and living with a bad set of ethics. It’s like parenting, but for society. It requires an authority, but a good [smart, individualistic] one. And that good one really is left to philosophers: the INTP and INFJ.

Other personalities at the helm can fight, but may lead to over-action, over-working ethics (Protestant ethics theory), war, over-organizing (development), traditional ideas and thinking, and so on; as opposed to **merely altering the environment and culture to allow others to develop naturally; That is, to increase the helping of each other, as opposed to abusing power to shape the world according to one’s own ideals.**

**Other personalities’ ideals simply are not worked out enough.** Only INFJ or a really experienced and personality-conscious INTP really have thought things through, still thinking while acting, as decisions and actions pass. It’s an on-going programme. The other personalities, especially Js, will shape the world, using instrumental rationality, toward their own ideals, without thinking about every small step to get there. [And as previously said, the other NPs are simply too unrealistic.]

**Those that think carefully about every action is rare.** Even youthful INTPs will fail, finding their way through the world through wrongful institutions and informations...
