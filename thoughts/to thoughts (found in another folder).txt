After Boy and The Beast, second half:
This film was much simpler than Wolf Children. Though, there were good bits: learn by doing first, then learn to teach, then learn from media; Be raised in the wild first, then go toward organized knowledge naturally by intrinsic motivation; gaining wisdom socially is more motivating; the time spent together learning will always be remembered (in both cases: with the beast and with the girl).

Dreamt of giving a speech against several governmental and corporate institutions, in the protection of Babycastles, and in general, good-hearted people.

Dreamt of going home, documenting a history of mom and dad, through recorded dialogs and photos. Also documented all of mom's recipes.
