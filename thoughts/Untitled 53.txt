Hello diary. Long time no see.

I am sorry. I haven’t lived for a long time now. I’m not sure if I’ll ever get back to you.
...

I had a low point in life this last week or so, falling into stupid social pressures, from nearby cultures. I went out to some stupid bars and wasted money on alcohol. Perhaps $100 in two weeks. Perhaps $60 in three nights. Stupid bars without any interesting souls in them. Ugh. The last time I’ve done that... was when I was a teenager!... That’s how I know it was a low point.

Anyway, now, how do I get out of this mess?

A quick trip to farm towns? Or...?? Busking?

Live alone? Live alone and busk?

Get back to using media as motivation? Forget people? At least until I can get back to Taiwan?

What about Taiwan? How will I even save money to get back? Can I even go to Vietnam? Will I have to search for another sane place to sleep? Another motorcycle? Restart the cycle I had in Thailand?...

This sucks.

...but I think money is the answer.

at least for now.
