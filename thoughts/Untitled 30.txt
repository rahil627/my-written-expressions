[morning:]
I really need to travel. Get out. Just walk. Wander. Talk. Consume. Eat. Live.

Just walk through whatever nearby countries. Indonesia? Bhutan? Vietnam. Any of them. Just walk. Don’t get too engaged. Do your work at night, on the computer. No hostels? That would be rough. Yet, hostels would waste money... They are quite worth the warm shower, electricity, and safety (especially in those countries). I think in rural areas I would be fine camping and hitch-hiking, or motorcycling. **Yeah, just continue motorcycling around other rural areas and small towns. That sounds pleasant. And, I could focus on my technical or conceptual works.**

**I live by watching the world, then piecing it together and dreaming of a better one at night.**

So, search for how to buy motorcycles for each country. Take an international driver’s license. Take a GPS tracker. **See if I can just ship it from Taiwan!** **If not, would have to get a touring bike that fits on an airplane, and really cut down on baggage. Which, I think is worth testing in Taiwan anyway.** Bicycle and motorcycle trips anywhere. Sleep and eat anywhere. Live anywhere.

**The ideal trip would catch all of the anarchic spaces and go through country roads,** leaving capitalism alone. Independent dwellers (organic farms, surfers, indie businesses, buskers, etc.) may be okay too. Cool! Not bad!

[night:]
I guess the way I have been living for much of my life is quite different from the way most people live their lives. I sort of wander, work within cultures. Other people rationalize, calculate, like farmers or overly secure future-planning suburban-dwellers. They actually think of things like business, how to stably get money, and so on. I, just wander until I find a good set of people or a good flow. There’s no calculate or future-planning beyond doing what feels right at the moment. Surely I strive for certain atmospheres, but it’s not rationally actualized.

The rational actualization is really really difficult for me. I’m great at socializing, working together, quite like a friendly sheep, but, sitting in one place, and rationally taking capital-driven actions is near impossible. I would much rather just work for an institution in the city or family business than to begin my own. It’s just more natural: It’s more social.

**Thus enters the problem of having to join good insitutions or create one. Apparently, I have never been involved in an institution that could take care of its inhabitants.** Now, I feel I must create one, but man, is it rough. To sit at home, create my own business for money? I guess **I just have to entice past friends or some local people to join me**, but, ugh. It all feels so unnatural.

Yeah, posting an ad on Facebook or even a local physical ad on the beach might be enough. Really need that extra person to do the bullshit economic work with. I usually don’t even want to think about it.

That’s where the Factory excelled for a lot of volunteers. **The volunteers didn’t want to think about what work to do, but, as long as there was work to do, they did it happily, together. It’s about just doing the work, without thought.** But **in order to achieve that, it requires a good insitution with good works.** Whether it’s farming nuts or making alcohol, it doesn’t matter. **As long as the work is ethically okay, in a homely environment, people, including people like me, would join.** **We would join because we just want to live and do what we want.** We don’t think about creating businesses.

**Thus, paradoxically good businesses are at the foundation of a good institution.** **A simple way for people to earn money, so that they can freely do whatever they desire.** From there, anything is possible.

In this way, art and business are not mixed up. Raising (including educating) children, expressing one’s self, is all done apart from the business.

In this way, the work becomes tolerable because a good group of people are doing it together. It should feel like hanging out. Or, perhaps similar to good groups of temporary labor workers, like longshoremen. Do the work without fuss, then, go back home or into the world to do whatever one desires. This is the independent way of life.

Communes, conversely, often have a communal way of life. And this, may be wrong, as I surely have thoughts on how my intentions and standards of living are much different from other inhabitants. So, though social, is not as satisfying as individualism.

Thus, **the hostel, or a shared communal space, a hang-out, seems best. People may remain individual, going toward each individual’s desires, yet, be together, sharing, and, when natural, coming together for projects.** **Nothing is forced. No forced meetings, chores, work. All is voluntary. Only in this way is true nature shown.**

Thus, **the business has to be voluntary too. People can work when they want.** Forced work, such as farming, would drive me crazy in a matter of days. It goes against my own nature, my personality. Capitalism is actually helpful here. More so than some sort of communized work shift.

**The communal space has to be voluntarily upkept. No chores. Any work on it is a gift from every individual.** Any major abuse to the communal space should be called out.

**From these two ideas, the voluntary business and the voluntary communal space, I believe a commune begins.**

**The communes I experienced failed because they lacked these core foundations. The Place of Arts failed because it had no business. No way for its inhabitants to make money.** It’s location was an incredibly rural “city” where you had to be incredible rural yourself to get a nearby job. Many communes do try to live closer to nature, which narrows the market incredibly. Trying to do any sort of contemporary work or art won’t sell at the local market. The digital market is the only savior. Its inhabitants were also unwilling to cooperate toward getting money. Toward art, sure. Sometimes they would even take money from other inhabitants (by selling or performing or whatever)! **The Factory failed because it forced work upon “volunteers”.** Thus, the work wasn’t voluntary. It’s a contract. **All “work exchanges” are work contracts, but even worse, work contracts without compensation. Basically, unwaged labor.**

The business, whether it is physical or digital, should be doable by nearly anyone. Or, better yet, there should be a choice of voluntary businesses (Marx’s dream). No personality left out!

Similarly, the communal space, should be hang-out-able by nearly anyone. Or, in the case of a shared dwelling, the home should be livable by nearly anyone. In both cases, accommodating all personalities.

The Factory also failed because they did not separate the market from the commune. Instead, they allowed people to exchange money and goods in-side each space!, giving it a hippie business feel on the first floor, as opposed to a home. Once one saw past the commodities and met the people, of course, one felt more homely, but, it created awkward situations. It sort of doubled as a tourist shop, letting tourists come in and buy naturally-made goods. The first floor served as a market-place.

It’s interesting, allowing tourists in. Allowing hippies to sell hand-made wares. It’s all done  quite naturally, but, the fact is that it’s not natural. That stuff should be left to the actual market areas, not the commune / communal space.

**The commune should be a home with family relations. No selling or buying. Just sharing,** just as most families do (I believe...). Though, just as helping and paying a mother that cooks food for you is surely desired, one may be compelled to help and pay the people that help you in a commune. The relations are more gift-oriented. Things are given to others out of intention: maybe you feel the other person needs it, or maybe you want to give it as a gift. More so, things are shared. Electronics and other expensive commodities are shared, used by everyone. Even co-working spaces are able to achieve this bit of communism.

Sharing though, creates another problem. Some people are able to take care of things and some aren’t. It’s not equal. What do parents do here? Hmm... Give the good kid good things and the bad kid bad things? Haha, maybe! Some people treat places like shit, some take care of it. I think, those that treat it like shit must be called out. Shared places require care, or, just cleaning up after one’s self, maintains a positive outcome.

Back to the commune. Then, yeah, It’s just a family home. That’s all. But, with artist-friends. **A shared home**, like a shared apartment with good friends. But **one in which everyone is taken care of.** Even friends might turn on you if you suddenly don’t pay rent or can’t seem to accumulate money. Families are usually more robust in this case, but exclusive, to their own kin. **Any real friend would be willing to let you live in their own home.**

Yet, **it’s surprising how few do allow one to live together.** **It’s the ultimate communal test. Would you be willing to let anyone live with you, when they need a place to stay?** Would you be willing to let any of your friends to live with you, when they need a place to stay? I think most will answer family only, very few will allow “best friends”, even less will allow their “close friends”, and **only those special hippies will allow anyone, anyone to become a part of their family.** Similarly, they take in whatever animals come to them too!

Yet, **it is only those special people that could ever create a truly egalitarian commune.** **The others are merely hippies** (in the negative sense). Sure, they’ve got some decent ethics here and there, but ultimately, they don’t care about people to the extant of treating them equally. The inequalities are there, just masked by a bunch of green ethics and shallow smiles, then they run back to their accumulated homes. **They don’t really care about others.** They only care about their own family, friends, and possessions, or more usually, just theirselves. It almost seems they are the opposite of a communist! Just vain people.

[todo: move to own blog post?]
Sometimes I feel there are two ways of seeing and treating people: one, everyone is an equal human, two, you’re just too busy with your own tiny rationalities in your mind. When one isn’t busy with one’s own desires, one can really see the the minds of others and be a part of others’ lives. When traveling, wandering, observing the world, freely flowing with people and cultures, I’m in the equal (carefree) mode. When doing work (art or capital or survival), I’m in the unequal (rational toward personal needs and desires) mode. I feel that I’ve spent more time in equal mode than most people.

**Given that I’ve only met a few people, all with the same personality type(!!) (INFP), that could really act communally, able to follow the golden rule: able to treat others equally, then, how could communism ever work?** There will always be those that treat theirselves, their family, their kin, unequally higher than others. They are an overwhelming majority. In fact, they are everyone, including those few people. Perhaps there are some exceptional saints may pass that near impossible test, but for the most part, it seems **there’s just no way...** Also, it seems rooted in personality more than any other factor.

**Are traits such as treating others equally, cooperation, caring for others taught or somehow comes natively (genetically)?** **I understand that the current structures and institutions of the world go against all of these traits, even teaching the opposites**, but, despite living amongst hipsters, hippies, and other outcasts, **I can’t say I’ve met anyone that does all three.** Caring for others equally [not mere charity] enters saint status. Other than myself at times, I really don’t know of anyone else who would independently help individuals out. Maybe some New Yorkers, for sure. Otherwise, the world seems bleak here.
