from wiki:
Portland is really really white (KKK!), but, the warmest, sunniest, and least rain of the “pacific northwest” (Vancouver, Seattle, Portland; the last bastion of white), but still, the third most rainy city;  second highest non-straight gender (after SF).

**Sacramento**, sunniest city in the world for 3 months! 7th highest non-straight gender. Only 20% white! Third best park system tied with SF and something else.

northeast megapolis: from Boston to DC. non-stop urban environment. largest in the US. SoCal is way more fucked up, with sprawl. second largest.

New York most transit friendly, a few points ahead of SF. Minneapolis with best biking, with SF, Portland, and Denver all more than 5 points behind and all quite close.

New York still the most diverse, cultural and media capital of the world.

Copenhagen has 1.5-2 hours of sunlight during winter months!!!

from Yelp boards:
Seattle as prettiest city in the US, with the best transportation, restaurants, etc. But, the grey is real.

$1000 for a studio in Seattle or for a 3 bedroom house with yard in Denver

Boulder: entitled hippies. Seattle: super expensive. Portland: weird. Denver: a great move for a person coming from Florida.

from city data:
Sydney: boring as fuck.
LA: a composition of many small cities.

Australia:
Sydney / some mix of SF, NY, and even LA near the beach, areas take years to explore
Melbourne / Boston, grid urban design, dense center with endless LA style suburbs
Perth / San Diego / Oz (from The Wizard of Oz?)

Sacramento vs Denver
**Sacramento** is way more diverse, warmer, water activities (river, delta), Sierras vs Rockies, access to Norcal, access to fruit farms and wine farms

Denver can be bland, boring even, more into sports, hiking, wholesome family things, unlike **NY, Seattle, and Portland, where culture is constantly recreated**.

from elsewhere:
Australian immigrants come from England, New Zealand, and other allies.

someone mentioned the southern cities with dense urban areas: New Orleans, Charleston, and one more. Lots of culture, but swampy climate.

good places for migrants:
US has 11 million temporary visas (tourist, research, school, etc.), nearly 500,000 permanent visas for family, and perhaps 50,000 for the diversity program.


immigration news:
most lonely: Sweden, UK, Japan, Italy

from the top tens:
Canada: immigrant friendly, programs for them, training, jobs, etc.; beauracratic, “must make appointment with wife to have breakfast” / can’t drop in on friends
Greece: takes in illegal immigrants, respects all religions, good people, beautiful, rich history
Bangladesh: one of the happiest, retain morals and hearts, only recently gained independence from Pakistan
Spain: great people and culture pitifully screwed by government, pressured by EU, forced to work in richer EU nations “like slaves”, much like the plight of Ireland: to be forced to develop
Denmark: brainwashed, xenophobic, homogenous, racist (appearance-based), cold-blooded, bland and boring landscape, terribly planned towns and villages, rule-based, lack of compassion, 500 days of winter; narrow-minded, singular personality (behavior and mentality): Danish, copy pasta for Sweden (lolol)
