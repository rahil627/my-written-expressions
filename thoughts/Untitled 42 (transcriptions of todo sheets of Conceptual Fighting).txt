# idea
new game idea, thought of just now, while transcribing:
A fighting game that builds tension as the fight goes on. I can imagine a shoot ‘em up  top down. The amount of bullets build up, get closer, slowly, over the round of a match, making each required movement more precise.

# concepts
“game play”:
avoiding the ‘neutral game’, relying on other ways to win
  - examples: Laura from SFV, Marth near the ledge
    - ‘set plays’ to lead to those other ways to win. For example: some attacks and baits to lead to having someone near the ledge.

Conceptual Fighting

The goal is to provide a sand-box game, so that from there, all that is required is to add art (especially animations), characters, balancing, effects on hit, ‘n’so’on

developer over-lay to balance the game.

# FGDC (towards an)
  - ideal input device
    - GC controller?
  - FG framework (Unity? 2D)
  - chat room? 24/7, forums
    - online social organizing
  - ‘net code’, Fight-code

# FG Maker (towards an)
  - allow players to create characters, upload, vote on balancing (human subjective), then can download from a database on-line
  - allow players to create stages, vote on how balanced


# past games?
**Blade 2**
  - **Samurai-esque!**

1. SF 3s
SF Alpha 2
Garou (MotW)

need to play all of them, with friend, learn 1 character match-up.
  - **history of fighting games**

# a history of fighting game mechanics
SF2
  - standard ‘fighter’
  - jump, low/mid block, forward/back throw, low/mid/knock-down hits (one attack can hit low or mid depending on timing), speeds, dash?, stun, delayed air attack, block to throw

SSF2T (ST)
  - super attack with meter

SF3S
  - parry (including air parry)
  - ‘command throw’ (grappler characters)
  - supers that are a throw (some grappler characters)
  - choose which super can obtain/earn multiple super attacks with meter
  - universal over-head (UOH)
    - usually slow, reactable 
    - some characters have other attacks that are over-heads

SF4
  - EX (what is this?)
  - focus (replaced parry)

# todo?
try net play from Taiwan

2D shoot ‘em up
first fighting game it create
1v1 / 2v2
choose attacks / buttons?
  - like Gradius
  - cool-downs?
move with a stick
aim fire with second stick
