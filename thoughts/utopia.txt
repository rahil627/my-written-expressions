# Naming utopia
What are those spaces where you can do anything? Be yourself. Be you. Do you.

Spaces of hope. Not just hope, but play! Spaces of play. Places that encourage play, playfulness.
Cooperation? Don’t have to cooperate. Can be alone if you want to.
Care? Hmmm. Don’t have to care either. Though, to a certain degree, people should?
Just have to be able to do what you want, **without constraint** / restraint / limits.
Free-play. Unrestrained play. Playces...
But it’s not just the place. **It’s the relations of the people within the space.**

Hmmm... It’s similar to the relations children have with each other. Rarely the relation between parent and child.

It could be a set of rules? The opposite? Not the system, but the non-system. The natural game. **Nature’s game.** We play nature’s game. Or the game of nature. The system is some other game, not nature’s game.

Eh, should just create a random name. Kira! Playto. Playnia. Playnos. Playton. Playtonia. Arcadia. Playns. Playa.

Sky. Sky is limitless. Reach for the sky. Welcome to the Sky.

Is it just the relations? Yeah. I think... One of society’s definitions say an extended social with a distinct set of cultural and economic organization
Maybe it’s a culture. Not a place. Not utopia. Not a dream place.
**It’s a culture. It’s just a set of certain shared values, behaviors. A tiny set. Without authority being the main one.**
Utopia is a society with utopian culture.
The natural culture. **Nature’s culture.**
Progress! Finally...

Glimpses of Nature’s Culture.

It’s **an ideal culture**. Culture is the main topic, not society. Society is people with a specific culture.

Or is it?...

**It’s not the society I’m seeking. It’s what makes that society utopian. It’s the underlying concepts. Yeah, it’s the culture: the rules, behaviors, etc. The playfulness, the care, the hope. The culture of utopia.**

The ideal culture.

And **not a full one, but an extremely flexible one; minimalistic.**

Ethics dictates how to live, behave. Culture contains values, beliefs. It’s not an ethic. It’s just a few simple values and beliefs.

**1. no authority (anarchy)
2. egalitarianism (let’s call it equalitarianism)
3. the golden rule (now that’s really utopian!)**

Now, what are the difference in these?

**If you treat others as you want to be treated, isn’t that equality? How can you control or have power over others if you believe in equality for all (equalitarianism)?**

**Egalitarianism is simply a belief. Anarchy and following the golden rule (categorical imperative?) are practices.**

**Anarchy doesn’t include equality. It knows that it’s not right. Some great individual may wield more power, just not in any constraining way. Anarchy comes first.**

**The golden imperative is an ideal. An near impossible one that will certainly fail to human impulses.** It’s unnatural. Even the most Buddha-like individuals fail. But it is an important ideal, when trying to live together ideally, taking everyone into consideration, learning ever more about each other.

**All one can do is try to reduce authority, misuses of power, constraints of freedom. Try to prevent it from forming again. Try to stay conscious of not letting people abuse power. Constantly call out authoritative actions.**

**Conversely, protect those that are unable to fight back, especially the more vulnerable individuals.**

**Some individuals will surely have more power, more influence. Some will be completely independent, detached. It doesn’t matter. As long as one is free to do either, and, one is not disabling the freedom of others to do anything, except the freedom to coerce. Thus, equalitarianism doesn’t matter.**
**The golden rule is but an extreme ideal ethic. It even goes against the nature of relationships. People give and take and do, freely, as they desire, according to each of their personalities. If one were to follow the golden rule, one enters *an extremely considerate state of mind* [todo: concept]. One is always conscious of how they affect others, and it requires so much effort that one cannot be one’s self. Thus, only anarchy is left.**

But anarchy denotes a society without authority. I’m interested in culture without an authority. Anarchic culture. Rebel culture? Outlaw culture? Anarchism.

Is anarchism a culture or a political theory? Both?

It’s a theory of social relations.
Wait, wtf is politics? I thought politics was conflict-negotiating. The way we resolve conflicts. How do anarchists resolve conflicts? By making sure everyone agrees with the resolution of the conflict. It’s extremely slow and difficult today because the pace of life is so fast, making decisions instantly, and actualizing them without the thought and consideration of how it affects everyone.
Is that part of anarchism?

Yeah...maybe utopia really is the wrong word. Anarchism is the right one. Or, at least, **a culture that detests authority.**

Marks of Anarchist Culture. Marks of Anarchism. Marks of an Ideal Culture. Marks of Idealism.
Idealism is a really good word too. The practice of forming and pursing ideals.
That’s way better than utopia! That’s exactly what I do! That’s exactly what I’m doing here. That’s my life.
Before one becomes and anarchist, one is an idealist. Guided by the ideals one forms. Especially moral ones.
Anarchism is limited to the dialectics of an ideal culture. Anarchism *is* *the ideal culture*, and its real. Idealism covers all dialectics: the ideals of games, films, art, technology, living with nature, love, life. Yes. That was the word I was looking for all along. lol.
