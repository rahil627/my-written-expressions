from another note:
I'm neither working or consuming. I feel nothing.

Things that stood out at Ilman: slow motion dancing, slow pace film, sounds of different cultures (language, instruments, ambience), a woman singing her heart out in a different language, crescendos.

I've lost my happy party adventure self and am transitioning into a working person.

Full work day Sunday and Monday. Work at nearby library and cheap cafe at night, and park to work out.

1. See possibility of freelancing in east Asia.
2. See design studios (new media and film) in east Asia. Contact them. Set meeting. See Alan's recommendations.
3. Research universities and art organizations in Korea.
4. Plan trip around Korea?

I want to babysit kids. I want to get close to someone. I need social obligations. The world is my social obligation. Fight for life.

Trampolines are fun.

Display fried chicken short film at a Taiwanese night market. Ask several electronic stores to display it.

Art needs an audience. Art institutions are worthless. Just make stuff and display it in the public.

It's too easy to experience something new through media. One can stay in one place and get experiences through media, or one could keep traveling. The difference is external, social. I dislike libraries because one cannot be social. People are near each other, but they aren't interacting. Similarly, I dislike narrative books. There's no interaction. One needs to share their experience with the medium with a book club.

I'd rather travel. Interact with the world. Live.

Take the social job, not the programming one.

你在以下的花需要導師。然後在晚上，blog。

我覺得了關於做什麼，關於開始公共街幾。我只做是找大樓，然後在每天工作，打電話土人。無聊，可視必要。

忘記其他的人？只有管自己？

一下。

在從臺北到台南呢：
第一，我覺得自由。我的心神集中外面。我覺得了關於目前。外面真的很美。

然後，我覺得集中頭裡面。我覺得了關於我的前程。做什麼？ 寶寶城堡？電影製片成？都可以？老師？僅僅住？

我忘記了怎麼生活？我不喜歡。外向時候我真的玩了。現在我沒有興奮。

我丟失官能的時候。我丟去方向。

我需要人。人跟類似的方向。

我覺得我自己用太時候了。這個錯不錯？

忘記都。轉入。沒關係。

不停。有常務。

用音樂。當自。

你要當一個人還是跟很多人？

12/3
我覺得學了通過生活，通過玩。因為我能學太小了。也我不工作了。如果沒有人做遊戲，我也不做遊戲。我改變亞洲的還是只懶。

我比試圖書館，自己。一切我做的，我做跟人。

然後玩了，我開始唸書。不好意思。這個方向沒有興奮。

現在自有時候我自己。

你必須保持動動！我覺得。

Class is efficient. Just ride the class. It's better than what you can do, unless you are really self-motivated.

Also, you need to find some fucking inspiration. Don't feel so trapped. You can do anything! But you need friends to regain this feeling. Don't hole yourself to some medium. Work with people. Interact. Fast projects.

Need to talk a lot more. Live a little!

Need to set time to create things or else I'll never create them.

12/4
在坐火車從嘉義到彰化：
我不理外面。我只想我的頭裡面。

我不想關於什麼我能做。

什麼重要的？家人？工作？完？世界？

替我，世界。stay schizoid。

今天，我覺得我剛需要說跟有人。

不跟人我睏倦。

我想法關於公街機。

可能，我要永遠。

我的其次應該有很好工作。

生活meaning玩還是工作？

A public arcade solves the problem of timing playtests and feedback. I really like this idea.

For a moment in time, I gave up. No struggle, just not caring for anything. No responsibilities. Perhaps I needed to let something out. Perhaps my schizoidness needed to break free from social activity.

I lost my care for people completely. I can stay awake at night, without caring about the world. I don't like it.

Go to sleep, find reason to be with people again.

在公園附近我家有菲律賓(Filipino)人。他們小心老的台灣人跟孩子。他們很關心。

因為現在我內向的，我只能寫，我沒有說。

Only able to think clearly while traveling. Clearly being fine art, big picture.

Also travel provide me a stable life. I interact with the world instead of routine converstion, which I'm often incapable of.

12/8
Learn mandarin by regularly being social with Taiwanese friends or classmates. Friends should be real, like my ODU friends, Babycastles. Play games, eat, travel together regularly.

Hong Kong 80s soundtrack.

I don't want to be alone, yet I want to do the things I want to. Perhaps I should take any job? No, now is not a good time. Take a break, come back, then search for a job seriously, without forcing yourself into Chinese class. Get inspiration from living cheaply.

You really need more work, to remind you that time is valuable, and so you fight for it again.

You have to find a job within the first two weeks, at least a part time one.

Begin calling people after class ends.

It's definitely winter problem. Seasonal affective disorder.

我坐在上飯店裡面。我看客人很雇工。現在我沒有方向。麼有方向人跟滿足人一不一樣？我將要從不是滿足。

is there ａ link to lack of creativity and learning languages? I think so.

從不 還是從未?

See babycastles last exhibition. Keep your New York friends.

12/12
Everyone in my class has a girlfriend, boyfriend, family, or many friends. I have no one, or at least I feel that way.

Life should be completely interactive.

Perhaps I should write more. Stop moving? That's no fun.

What's the point of learning another language? I don't like making meaningless conversation with others.

Like maccandless, I'm unable to fit into society, yet I enjoy being some part of it.

I need to write more. Create more. Sometimes, creativity comes from the self, and it's the self fulfillment that matters most.

Eh, that's just documentation. Exploration is what excites me the most.

Complete empiricism and the denial of school. I've always been an empiricist. I learn things by play. I've read less than 10 books in my life, including comic books. In college I watched a lot of films, especially those that depicted the lives of people whom I see less in contemporary society. Films have been the medium of my choice until I began traveling, and I became more social, more interactive. Then, I discarded film too. There's enough to experience in life, especially when one is traveling. At some point I came to Taiwan. In Taiwan I was still in travel mode. Consuming, having new experiences everyday with people. I couldn't stand not talking to people for more than an hour. I used a radio when I couldn't hear people speaking.

My goal was to learn Chinese, so I consumed as much as I could, refusing to be myself and instead living externally. This refusal I believe existed during all of my travels. I've been living extrovertedly.

Then, when Taiwan became less interesting, when I got an apartment alone, the introvert came back. I stuck to my mandarin class, but it was difficult. I fought hard, taking any opportunity to go out, even if it meant to a bar with a hostelmate. I really wanted to travel, get out of Taipei, but I forced myself to stay, for the sake of the class.

My mind has gone numb. I am not thinking about the world anymore. I'm not even thinking. I'm blank.

12/13
I'm ignoring the world. I'm not thinking about the things I can do. Was it the move the the apartment? The lack of school or a regular job? What am I supposed to do? I can do anything. But I have no regular social life. I need people. I don't have my hostel friends or school friends anymore.

Need to spend all time outside. Need a social life. Can't make games alone. Need to start a scene. Hackathon everyday?

Wherever I live, I need work, with people. Or social enough with my own work. Or freelance and travel.

The next time you find an apartment, live with someone else in the same room. Being alone is terrible.

Not enough intellectual stimulation?

Be social with other game players and makers and artists.

Exercise doesn't replace social activity!
運動不

在象山我覺得好些。高。為什麼我總是設陷阱？自己。

第二來台灣的時候我覺得了我有人。錯。我是自己。我麼有朋友。只有臨時的人。

錯。kumiko, alex, sarah, iris, piedro, xuenzhi, 還有這裡。 為甚麼我總是去？因為我不知道怎麼時間表。我錯。

我不以自為滿足。

可能我只需要運動還是聊天。

不吃。starve。

Games for change. Mass social games.**********

Organize mass game events.

Only when you are alone do you get feelings for others. When you have people you forget.

今天是沒用。我能了打電話旅行的公司，可視我走腳踏車去了。我悶。明天，我早上應該起床，然後打電話每個人！

Tsai Ming-Liang said you shouldn't feel so absorbed by film. It isn't real. After being social for a long period of time, I feel this way. It's only when I am lonely that I become absorbed by film. Otherwise, I prefer live interaction, performance. Something real.

Without people near me with a normal schedule, I lose track of time and people. I need people, and light.

12/15
And, after a few days of mass depression, just like that, I become my former loner self. I don't mind being awake when everyone is sleeping. I don't care for the world. I only care for myself.

Which life is better?

12/16
As soon as Natalie came in, I woke up. I need people around me, all of the time. But then, how do I be myself?

Order pocket multitool!

And I forget. Being social is so much more fun. Less research, more impulse.

Without people, I don't feel like doing anything, like an Asian. I need to be more American. Enjoy my time away from people.



今天要做：
充值你的喲喲手機。打電話u-bike。

Google你的腳踏車。Merida的網站。

訂購旅行的東西：大的包包，小的睡袋，水平，小工具，。告訴我的爸爸。問他關於大的包包。

活。

買郵局色魔同車。

就的筆記；
這些孩子從不可外面。怎麼樣他開公司？

明天，打電話朋友。坐在早餐店。看見我的餐食。學中文。穿很多衣服。試做。在晚上去高雄。修補我的表。舒暢。

12/17
沒有噪聲，你成為瘋狂。你需要人。

都藝術需要人。遊戲跟電影需要人。在日間我需要醒著的。起床！

只要你在臺北，你應該在外面。不需要旅行。臺北非常好。真的。往事沒關係。 :)

12/18
It seems I'm always fighting for ways to spend time with people without actually spending time with them. I'm only with people for my own selfish needs.

When I travel I have enough energy because I'm excited to see the world. When that ends, I stop waking up, I'm less excited, eventually going to depression and rely on friends, or fall back to work and games and films, and I don't want to be unsocial again, so it has to be multiplayer games.

I need to be in a place with a lot of energy. The lack of energy in my apartment, in libraries, inside, kills me.

Like mom, if I am stuck in a building, I become depressed, sleepy, don't feel like moving, sleeping for a day straight.

I need people to constantly ask me to go out because I won't ever ask. I need interesting events to go to.

Can music cure depression? Unsociability? I think in the past I used media to transport me, to replace people.

12/19
Try to return bike.

今天我起床在family mart. 今天初不好，慢慢。我不要起我的腳踏車。我用音樂。我覺得我的就的旅行的自己。獨來獨往。然後起，我覺得好。我有方向。可視我 還沒說話。

去高雄，其次去atm,然後買東西，其次聽太難？，其次去臺北。睡覺。

起床。檢查派對幾點。買禮物。賣腳踏車。

12/20
我起床晚一點，十一點。

我慢慢學了怎麼生活自己。需要媒體，網絡，手機。我的生活在郊區。我需要學校還是工作。

12/21
To learn a language you need to be social (real life and use internet when you can't be around people in real life) and read a grammar book. Or just take a class.

I don't need to consume art. I just need a healthy social life. Then I consume life, am inspired by it, then able I create something. Perhaps high art should be consumed when I am lonely, or to keep up with modern times.

I holed myself. I stopped interacting with people. I haven't learned how to maintain relationships. Keep up social activity.

My mind is completely separated from reality. I'm not thinking about the people around me, or things I need to do. My mind just wanders.

Yes. I need a normal social life, then spend the spare time to make very social, very high art.

Lucid dreams about a large warehouse as my studio with the best artists in town, plus kids, workshops, cloud gate, ultracombos, Simon, my arcade.

My projects and direction keeps changing. Stick to Taipei. Learn Chinese through school. Teach. Open a studio. Make games. Have playtest, film, and game events.

12/22
My directions change because I am not around it. I only do what's around me. If I live in a hostel, I spend time with and care for the people in it. If I live in Taiwan I want to learn mandarin. A lot of my life depends on placement.

It also depends on my daily life. If I live in an apartment, it's possible for me to forget everything. I'll forgot to contact my family, friends, everyone. It just doesn't come to mind. Instead, I'll just keep wandering until a new direction is created by intrinsic motivation. 

I need to stick to a routine, do work, be social. I need to remind myself by consuming the similar things until the project is over. I need to stick my goals on a wall. I need to set deadlines. Then create new ones when those are complete.

Yet, I also need to keep moving. I can't stand being alone in an apartment, in a quiet library. I need to keep myself busy. It's a tough balance.

Perhaps the best thing to do is create giant goals, and constantly strive toward them. Create a profitable new media and film studio. Consistently learn Chinese. Get a girlfriend. Apply for NYU. Release one game per month. Create one film per month. Teach. Pay off debt. Deadlines! Festivals! Etc.

What about fine art? Fine art will reappear when I am working all day. Then perhaps I will deeply care about the world again.
--

Perhaps in Taipei I ran out of interesting people and things to consume? Nah. It's just me. I started with immense creativity then went down.

Perhaps a job will provide me a normal social life?

Need a reason to wake up in the morning. I need people around me. Then I need to go outside. Anywhere. Consume everything, not just fine art. Be social with everyone. Learn Chinese.

Perhaps the problem is that when I sit down to do work I become lazy? Not willing to travel far out? At least not without reason such as an event. I lose my interest in the world except for narrow interests, which is likely related to my work.

During my depressing last days in Taipei, I felt that the inhabitants of Taipei were very much related to the indigenous peoples. Their faces, hard-working, uncreative culture, friendly, welcoming.

12/27
Daydreaming about explaining the feelings I get while traveling, and a problem with my personality: There was a time in the Caribbean we went snorkeling. After some time people went out to sit and socialize. I didn't. I kept snorkeling. I wanted to see what else is there. I wanted to try to dive deeper, hold my breath longer, see more species of fish. I wanted to maximize the value of my time there. And my brain only thinks about traveling, nothing else. I consume what's around me.

I'm obsessive.

The goal in life should be to stay connected. Constant communication.

Can't concentrate on my own work with people around me?

Whatever work I do, be process should be social! If I want to make games, it should be with people. I either need to enlighten Taiwanese people or go back to New York.

There's no use of doing it by myself, is there? It's so sad. One has to mix their work with the local. Make games on a street in India. While traveling. Outside with Bharatbhai. Never alone.

Why even come to India? I could have been in a studio in Taipei.

Fuck games. Teach in Taipei, learn Chinese. Humans. Vincent Moon.

Shilpaben asks why work on a computer? Change your job. I have to do what I want to do: I want to make my own art.

Create feedback! Make in the public. Test in the public. Constant playtesting.

12/28
Being alone, on a computer is un memorable. Time passes fast. I need to be outside whee there's a ton to consume. Learn language, be social, eat together, etc.

Avoid using the bright lights inside the house.

12/29
Spending way too much time alone. Narrowing focus too much on work. Need to be broad.

In Asian countries, people work longer hours, but have more free time, socializing. It's their life, not just work. It's healthy, but it doesn't give them time to be themselves.

Speakers are better than headphones. At lest clamping closed ones.

I hate computer screens.

Dreamed of hosting a series of mandarin teaching games. A set time after class to reinforce knowledge through game.

I should be writing about life, the affect of play on people!

The goal of a schizoid artist is to learn to work on art with other people around, during normal hours.

My greatest problem: I narrow my interests to a point where I am working on something pointless.

12/31
I wake up late, thinking about what to do while snoozing, not having reason to get up. After getting up, I feel great. The sun is healing.

Uninspired by the world. Not caring about social life. Just me, as I was in San Francisco.

D845GBV

As long as I am social during the day, outside, I can work at night.

It wasn't the weather, well it kinda is, but even more so it's my direction and peers that keep me alive. I need reason to wake up. It seems I'm unable to maintain motivation alone anymore.

All I have to do is spend more time on the streets, and with people, to feel good. Even the streets of New York. Not alone.

All that time I worked on things alone. A waste. I need friends to work with. I either need to be a leader or go back to New York and join the community.

My room, in any country, is depressing. Light and people immediately cure me.

The lack of radio destroyed my day.

Just keep creating. Fuck study and consumption. It's time to write and make stuff. Only socialize to learn a language.

"Love is not all about looking at each other. Love is about looking forward together." - HONY comment

I can't work alone.

Wherever you go you must work with people.

The excitement of creating (and learning) comes from social contact of others with similar interests. Playing smash, making games, learning Chinese.

Social during day work at night? No. Need to mix work and social. Never work alone. Find ways to make work social.

Just work on CB, Unity games, Chinese, and Gujarati. :) steady work for a month. Also can write to create, use technology to talk to friends.

As always I think best when I am alone. Then I focus on fine art, struggle, and want to work hard. Live alone, travel alone, yet live with anonymous people.

Street life is so much better. I need to live on the streets, work with artists, stay outside, be with people with a similar purpose all of the time.

Constantly explore, learn, and play together. No down time.

Thinking in Chinese is better than listening because it is in my direction.

More lucid dreaming. Directing concerts of Vampire Weekend in India.

1/2
A complete lack of social life, deadline, and feeling. Should be working! Need to spend more time outside.

1/3
More on narrow focus:
I chose to do lonely things in India: make games, blog, write, etc.

It's because of my narrow focus that this is all I do and all I care about. I'm not consuming the world around me. Not caring for friends.

When I travel, I focus on the world. The work I do is likely to be documentary related, roti delivery, humans.

When I learn Chinese I focus on talking to people in Chinese, trying to do work that will help me learn Chinese: social jobs, cafes, bars, government jobs.

Both are socially healthier than doing a lone job. I'm capable of doing them all, I'm just incapable of balancing them.

Need to relax. Chill with Bharatbhai, and later, Shila, Dad, Nalina, Don.

I've had this feeling before, I just need to go out of the house. Overthinking.

I can't work alone because i overthink. I need people.

Sitting at Karelibaug:
I've lost all feeling for people, interaction. My playfulness. How can people be playful alone? Actually, I was. I've just lost it, hopefully only for a moment.

A lack of sunlight? No. A lack of direction.

1/4
There's an alternate world that can be created by computers. Sense of time is lost. Music replaces the world.

1/5
Depression. See notes on how I solved it.

Perhaps being social is not they key. It's the balance of being social, working, and doing personal work. I need to surround myself in work and projects, or travel.

Yet being social creates memories.

My goal in life is to make everything social: learning, playing, and working, in a direction I like.

To do that, all I have to do is lead people to do things that I want. That's it. Instead of searching endlessly.

Fuck overthinking. Do the work and socialize. No more playtime. Only spend free time to fly kites and be with family.

Use Unity to complete a game. Force self to learn Gujurati, Hindi, and Chinese. Have to use past thought to create high art, or at least the design.

I like my life to be a constant adventure. Time away from adventure should be painful, only alleviated by being social while working or music.

Remember to watch movies to keep you thinking about the big picture.

A life without media, everything inspired by life, everything consumed is life. No media. Interaction, real interaction.

1/6
Absolute depression. If my work does. It involve people, then I become depressed, because I have no life outside of work, at least in India I don't.

1/7
During depression, I can focus on films, consumed by it, replacing it for life and exploration. It's not right, but it makes me feel better, continue with life. Now, I feel this is wrong. Was I in depression before I traveled?

I need a community to survive, whether it's work, a city, or a class. I need it. Without it, I have no social life. Without that, I lose my interest in the world.

Instead of consuming the world, I begin to consume media, nonstop. Film. Music. It replaces life experiences.

I consume what's nearby, publicly. I thrive off the intelligence of cities. The more intelligent the city, the more intelligent I become.

Blog SF vs NY for a schizoid. Peer groups and influence. A failure to be a leader of a peer group. Heavily influenced by peer influence during travel, for the sake of being social.

I need to maintain my identity and participate in social events.

What's life without work? I need to work, and only work that requires a lot of thought entices me.

Keep wayfaring, or learn to take responsibility? Goals or just live, happily, playfully.

A diverse event with a deadline. Continue with creative work, diverse and deadlines. Keep changing the work.

Need to learn to balance time.

1/9
It takes me time to watch A City of Sadness. Almost two hours in I finally get into it. Too generic? Seen Taiwan? Too slow? Not real enough?  Not modern. Need another person to watch with? Desire for real interaction.

Should spend time thinking about inventions to help the third world. Masks, safety helmets, balcony guards, houses designed for safety, a campaign by a celebrity.

Easy, just see stats for deaths and illnesses.

Is it possible to be social solely with a city? Yes, I did in SF and NY, but I should still collaborate or work full time with people, then I can travel on my own.

1/10
A care for others vs being content with oneself. Shouldn't be a decision, it should be a balance.

I put my headphones on, and I realize, all that time I was programming in SF and NY alone, wasn't a terrible thing, I was just being me, in my thoughts, in my world. Sometimes that's needed. Control it.

Wondering around the internet too much. Need to focus on the world.

I feel parson's student work is too small, too media oriented. Perhaps MIT is only worth it.

1/12
Cafes are needed for people to work on their own project without being too social. A public workspace.

Or just work outside. Both interact with people.

I watch movies when I get home because it replaces life. I need a certain amount of life at all times.

1/13
Electrical adapters for India, and a face mask.

A blog about music, computer work, and a lack of life. Living through play. Experimenting with life. Failing.

1/14
Competitive games (including poker, tag, drinking games, digital fighting games) provide a new experience every play. There's a system. Other media and performances do not. This is what beings me back to playing games. This is what I must make. Competitive games. From now on, all games shall be competitive.

Have fun in the morning and perhaps then rest of the day will feel better. Need the social outlet, sun, and fun.

The problem is trying to really let go.

Perhaps I need to choose one direction and just be satisfied going in that direction? Nah, it has to be an exploratory process. Just don't change course too much.

Check Shila Internet.

1/15
Stayed too long with that one terrible uncle. A bad use of time. I need to really watch my time. There's only 365 days per year, and it takes about a month to create something great, and a day for a prototype.

I'm getting to the point where I'm unable to extract useful information from people, which is why I'm a loner in the U.S. Narrow interests. A need for personal space.

I've been changing my direction, learning, towards things that are local and social, but sacrificing my true interests. The next time I go to Taiwan, I need to stick with art, work several hours in personal art, take Chinese classes, be social for release and fun? Is it possible for me to output great work with people? Only artist collaborations.

8 hour create, the rest will inspire me to create, so it shouldn't be related to my work.

1/16
Perhaps I should just go back to New York now.

In Taiwan, complete at least one project. Stay social by running events. Collaborate through social events. Determine move to New York. Live on the streets. Sleep on the streets. Be a street poet. Freelance my technical skills.

Never stay inside of a house, unless there's a party.

1/18
Suddenly, after the kite festival, life becomes suffocating. I'm not doing what I want to. I need my space.

Being in a car with Nisha is suffocating. Being at 64 is equally suffocating. I've stopped talking, traveling, having fun.

I need to be alone and join during events. School, work, parties. Not simply hanging out, certainly not with people who aren't my friends.

There are so many kids that are smarter than their parents. What prevents their advancement: education or parents? They're limited to physical exploration. Have kids not learned how to use the internet or libraries to gather specific information?

1/19
My recent depression is because I am not actively chasing my current direction. I chose to go see Dad, make games, but to actively do it turned out to be quite difficult.

Stop the caffeine, sleep a little.

Was is my ability to adapt, peer pressure, or adapting to be socially healthy that drove me in Taiwan?

Lost all social ability. Need friends. Need my classmates.

1/20
Physical media is so much more fun.

The difference between me and most other Indians, especially Gujaratis, is that I'm empirical. Gujaratis favor a house in isolation. I prefer a city.

Every game should be physical, even if some elements are digital.

1/21
Thoughts about an ideal new media studio. Something between Ultracombos and treasure hill artist village.

A hackerspace?

Blog / think about difference between tag and chess. One is easy to have fun with, the other requires deep tactics and is easily accessible.

1/22
Fuck my family's house dwelling style. That's the cause of my depression. I can't be near them because they're fucking boring.

Spending time outside is necessary for me to live. And not just a fucking park. I need to physically be near and talk to people. Maybe Dad's house dwelling style is holding mom down.

Proteus the world.

Spectate game worlds.

1/23
I'm a constant observer of life. I need to consume life to feel life.

Game design jam if eyes hurt. Start work Saturday.

To Taiwan todo: choose a social career path. Can try programming in a social place? Start a film jam, need one person that similarly likes Tsai Ming-Liang. Change career to film and TV?

Before beginning work, take local trains around Taiwan. Relax. Always relax. :)

Audiobooks!

Perhaps film is better. A film studio.

Any place with people to manage my time.

1/27
Feel relaxed in Bombay. It's cozy in Bandra. Lazy. Directionless. Yet, I have so much I'm supposed to do. How can one live so lazily? I guess in  India, you don't have to work much to have a good living. The lack of struggle is not inspiring for me.

I need to make plans for tomorrow to see the gritty side of Bombay.


1/28
Wouldn't have woke up if people weren't in the house. Woke up when someone finally rang the doorbell.

I still feel lazy, uncaring for the outside world. I'm not traveling nor experiencing life.

Which life is right, on the streets and staying in a hostel and going to events or inside of a house or office? The former provides much more experience, fun. The latter is needed to focus on a single subject.

One should balance both. Work while experiencing, outside, at a friends house, cafe, on the streets, at events. Like working in the back of a u-haul with Babycastles.

Film:
Lunchbox

Shila Verizon
Watch a Chinese film everyday?
Begin social interaction soon, collaborate, public art spaces for events, propose ideas and events to current spaces

1/31
Need to get back to work. Wandering aimlessly too much. Yet, I need some social life. Guh. Hopefully better tomorrow.

It's so difficult to do something people aren't already doing. It's easy to find and join events and people. It's difficult to get people to do something different.

Now has come the time to do my own thing and have others follow me.

Film or game jam next weekend. Need deadlines! Well, can work these two weeks, then do Chinese and teach afterwards, filling in weekends with jams.

Goals: build a game and film community. Create a studio / team for each. Consistently make things together. It's all about event scheduling. Tell them to get together at certain times.

Walk around to see apartments to rent. Call now. Aim for open studio. Figure out how to find a studio. Ask Jay!

2/1
Find stray dog, priest, hipster, bum.

Living as experience. Computers are not an experience. Music is.

Film jam every weekend. Start Friday night. Shoot Saturday and Sunday. End Sunday night.

Use contests for themes and deadlines.

Use film competitions for deadlines.

優先權：
日間：
交際工作，探險
一。找房子，探險，人的太灣
二。找電影的人

晚上：
不焦急的工作
一。念書， 一個半鐘頭
二。結晶鬥毆，三鐘頭
三。我的遊戲， 三鐘頭
四。網誌我的思想，遊戲

我好受。可視，我覺得我需要有人跟我。我需要鬥時間。

明天問peter看房子。如果可以，開旅行？
今天探險跟人的台灣。

Make arcade cabinet with raspberry pi at the hackerspace (see crystal brawl post). Set up at a night market. Ask public spaces to take in, tonghua arcade! Yeah! Design and create a new arcade cabinet based on local talent and Taiwan inspired. Traditional Chinese calligrapher, Chinese painting vs hire contemporary artists.

打電話紅色的紙。每天。

2/5
woxuyao

買水平從夜市。

Losing focus. Need to wake up earlier. Socialize.

Need to use music to focus. Need to live alone, in the city.

Smart people talk about the big picture, but I like to focus on the human element, and make a big picture out of that. I need ethos.

Need exercise to work efficiently.

Going in and out of art is weird.

2/6
Computer work is making me less social. I feel nothing from the world. I'm losing interaction.

電腦的工作做法我少社交的

The professional world is so far from the rest.

What am I looking for? Isn't it best for me to work in the public? Why am I always looking for people?

Balance chinese, work, personal events, computer work in the public. I need more life. More travel.

Just do shit yourself. Stop looking. Co-working cafe is a bore?

I really don't like cafes either. Not enough life, energy, people talking. The hostel is better. So are parks. Need to keep talking, making, and working. I need more noise!

Cafes are too boring, not enough sensory experience, feedback, satisfaction, not playful enough. Hostels are better. The public is also good. Playgrounds.

2/7
我要保持玩。我無電腦的工作。我需要年輕的人。

2/8
我聽說話。因為我電腦的工作？我覺得。在早上我需要起床。怎麼樣？乾電腦。

我的生活需要冒險。我不可以。

如果我在街，我創造台灣的人，跟念中文。

我需要人。我需要工作還是讀書。然後旅行還是藝術品。

Get the fuck out and explore during the day! Goddamnit. Don't stay indoors. It's making you fucking unsocial and lazy.

--

And it makes you feel less progressive. There's no feedback. It's difficult to do anything without social feedback.

--

明天：
一。打電話都房子
四。 打電話都英文的學校, 不如果作文化大學， and take resume with you

The goal is to be social, then drag others in my direction.

To do work, all one has to do is workout and do the work while listening to music. No more is needed. Before work, the design should be complete.

2/9
我要能感情跟工作嗎？我應該買最便宜的房子還是貴的？

運動。不和咖啡因。睡覺，唯一你很累。派代跟運動。

Finish台灣的人一分。開始二分。高平，比較好的故事跟相片。

如果我住自己，我應該能夠

2/11
我要買更多冬天的衣服，然後我可以作外面。

買手機的電子。

The cold and work make me clam up, into an angry person. I hate the rain so much. How can one think clearly in the cold and rain? Time?

Time to live the American life. Start with work then have fun at night.

And as I work, I remember what media is for: to see the rest of the world. The world you don't have time to interact with because you're working and maintaining relationships.

I'm made for Humans of Taiwan and Tsai Ming Liang films.

Digitally distributed physical games

Host game and film nights at my house!

2/11?
Computer work is not working. Need daily social life. Need to want to go out everyday and night. Need to!

Get apartment, then travel, then find school (in a socially fun way). Need social energy. Perhaps my own studio is a bad idea.

How do I do thing with people all of the time? Start by being social, traveling, then start jam, then start work, with people. I have to lead a team, organize them, to start something great. I was in this position last time I was in Taipei. Should I put myself into that position again? Perhaps so. Do computer work between social times.

2/12
It's not about what you make, it's about the experience of making it.

When one travels, lives, there is no reason for art. Life is enough. Why ever see media? When you are alone, stuck, unable to live.

Ask to work in class. Work while prepping for teaching? No! Make analog games and activities! Be more social, innovative, explorative.

12/13
It's about where you spend your time. That's where art comes from. Live in a city and it will affect you, just by living in it. Live in a poor area and perhaps you'd want to make film, help people. But then you sacrifice intelligent contacts. Living with the poor is an experience to inspire, yet I need constant inspiration to maintain.

Is it better for me to live in a poorer place? New Taipei City? I think so. What if I adapt to it, and it no longer inspires? Move again? Nah, it's best to be central and go out everyday.

It's okay. Use a bike more often: saves 40-60nt+ (1000-2000nt) Use u-bikes! Even more convenient. Umbrella and u-bike. Eat at cheaper restaurants or cereal at home (1000-3000nt). Buy a water bottle. Avoid tea and soda.

To have an adventure simply means doing something no one else does.

Go out! I hate being inside so badly! I need to live on the streets again! Fuck computers.

First. You need a social life, even if it isn't with the smartest people, then you can start your own projects and lead others.

Keep talking to other artists!

12/14
Fight depression. Travel. Get excited about the world again! Saturday and Sunday. Go the fuck out! Every night, go the fuck out. Humans. My own events. Hang out. Call friends. Night markets, travel. No night clubs.

Don't stay home and document shit yet. You need to let go. Be social. Have fun.

Yangmingshan？ When I go out, it should be social! If not, watch grand films. No, just call people up. Meet up. Do things together.

2/8/14
Is there a way to experience life while creating?

2/15
Donate Babycastles.

Relax. Teach. Go out. Study Chinese. Socialize. Consume world, not media. But give yourself deadlines!

Keep playing! :)

1. Study Chinese
2. Crystal Brawl
3. Personal games
4. Find teaching job
5. Search apartment and roomies.   - Post at makerbar Taipei, prefer chatty females*
  - post on bulletin board
  - ask students at Wenhuadaxue*
6. Humans. Stay outside.

Nothing beats walking the streets, and biking, and long distance travel. Subways somehow don't give the consumption feel.

2/16
問的天氣治癒我。

你應該用寫字代替拼音（pinyin?)

我需要探險！經歷。練習中文。

看沒有家的狗。*

2/17
點另一音樂幾？在夜市可以。

As an experiential person, I think it's important to always be surrounded by people, including my apartment, even if I spend most of my time working on something else.

Life and experience motivate action. But how does one maintain the experience?

Major life arcs: use programming to make enough money to become a full-time filmmaker.

Is it because I am using the computer alone? Is it possible to be social and physical and use the computer? Take a laptop into a physical and social place? Still, can only talk, not play.

For anything to be exciting, it has to be social. There's no other way. Need a group, if not, a community.

Sit in tonghua park to relax.

The podcasts are not so great for grammar. Just vocabulary and listening. It's better to read the book, create sentences (socially or not).

I have to be social in whatever endeavor I choose.

Find / order another Sansa clip。

Do apartment math again.
10000*6+10000+5000=75000+
＋450
7000*6 = 42000
27000 difference
15000 loss

Need to focus. Class. 8 hours work. Then socialize? Then build communities about my interests. Add writing before sleep to schedule while watching adventure time.

遵守台北旳街。

買Rice禮物。

maker magazine
Robocon
Makerbar! Really good place to work! A bit exclusive though.

Perhaps film is best, as it's not as exclusive. Or perhaps high art is inherently exclusive.

Maybe I will always be a lone artist.

Find places to play, not work, then work there.

Find places to play board games and talk. Play new indie games, watch films, become close to each other. Working together and playing together is different.

2/18
Go to hostel, get iPad and Camera.*
去宿舍，我的電子果四很相機。

See hostel at night?
每天看宿舍？

Go to makerbar?*
去maker酉吧。

In order to be happy, I need a social life. Computers can only be used once I have a regular social life. And warm.

2/19
停留外面。

在班我學無忍受的。

我需要學中文用我的方法。

三：在很多時間浪費通勤。 不成為懶！
四：看肘子遊戲。
七：問Peter中文書的名字。

list all board game and meetups. Follow up on Rice, Kelvin, Vinay, old classmates.

Call Miranda? message Simon.

Film should take in the entirety of Taiwan into account.

Start from the farm, scooter to a market, someone buying from the market, working at a food stall, pushing the food stall past a motorbike of a family, the family works a at a boring company... Etc.?

Films that travel, like Enter the Void. Long street shots.

2/21?
To Mandarin:
Memrise radicals and words. Don't look up each. Memorize the radicals and see and say then as you go through. Just keep pushing forward

Read, then write from memory? Don't be so lame. Create more! Explore more! Stop being lazy. Be excited!

Don't focus on school or programming. Focus on social life! Need it for excitement! Humans of Taipei!

Need to stay outside so that I feel that I am living.

Need real motivation. Brain doesn't work without it. Alex does the work.

如果我的老師不玩的跟社交，課不有用的。

Go out somewhere Friday, Saturday midday, and Sunday. Everyday. Spend no time at home! Work in random parks, makerbar, hackerspace. Use u-bike! Keep creating!

Need to live more, outside, and talk.

Try:
keep meeting people! Especially specific artists to work with.
1. OpenLab
2. Language cafe / other thing / hostel
Write down game days
Explore alone too! Can go out any weekend or day! Just take laptop and books with you. :)
Relax. Chill. Play games. :)

Spend free time having fun and talk with Taiwanese people. Never foreigners. No need to travel. Chillax in Tonghua. That family. Rice. Old classmates. Walk around more. :)

1. Personal games***
  - prototype before playtest!
  - get Pinkies Up ready?
2. Crystal Brawl
3. Chinese
4. Blog designs
5. Life? What about high art? Social things! Social and productive!

Need more direction, or motivation. Argh. Films? Don't be so directional for consumption though. Appreciate the world, social life. Relax. Walk around the city. Don't be so narrow when consuming.

Now: makerbar, vinay, park, computer work and chinese.

If no locker, order old iPad. Later, buy camcorder.

Monday, try class, if not good, switch, ask last day to switch.

找工作。叫英文。

每天晚上寫字。新的譬如。

買iPad在eBay.
開電影的contest.
Balance direction and experience. Have to think highly, then lowly, having fun, appreciating everything, enjoying everything.


四：看iPhone and agenda
五：看電子遊戲的event
八：找桌子遊戲還是旅行* witch house, set meetup in Chinese on meetup.com and or BBS, new game once a week. Once per week?
九：在晚上，prototype我的遊戲
十：看NGO? A gritty one.
十一：找教的工作*
十二：看Ilo Ilo， 看時間，得到號*
十三：
十四：adventure time meetup? Can't I just be social like Sarah and Koya? Why did I push away?

Akmi, witchhouse, world tree, 

Set deadlines! Regain inspiration and energy! Regain social life. Regain struggle and high art. San Francisco was good for development, but I lost focus. I need to balance life.

Sleep anywhere in the heat. Only have to be back for class and/or work. And can skip class!

Keep having fun every day and weekend and any time off. Balance work and fun!

用u-bike. 

2/23
To schedule:
Weekends: go out and travel with hostelmate and/or Taiwanese people, or alone. Be explorative again. Take breaks. Fight for time. Time to explore the world. Find more things to do. Keep consuming. Keep playing.

Doing unsocial work such as programming alone, especially away from people or a cafe, I feel unreal. I need to interact with people, yet do my own thing.

Perhaps programming was a bad idea.

Go to makerbar? A park? Explore New Taipei City? Where you go you should interact with people. Eat dinner with Rice. Go to meetups. Practice Chinese. Be more professional.

Really need social life.

Need a girlfriend. Need to time work and social life.

If I get to the point I look for events before going out, then I've become too directional, forgetting that I'm in Taiwan. Forgetting to talk to the people I know. Forgetting to set events and play with them.

Video games are too narrow.

Go out and stay out everyday. Get others to join my adventures: high art, travel, biking everyday nice day.

Film jam vs camping every weekend.

Bike adventures and travel after class.

我現在很懶。like San Francisco。 需要做跟工作。

Need to play and socialize more! Advance Chinese.

Getting lazy. Need to travel further out. Getting too comfortable. Need to party more.

Set meeting with landlord. But keep exploring! 

A fucking waste of time. Need

2/24
Opt for same class as classmates next semester!

Think about grammar.

寫我的思考用全部的句子。

看電影的藝術

Worry less. Be free as you are while traveling. :)

Or, worry more? Fight for time.

You can do anything. No reason to go home. In fact, going home makes you lazy. Be homeless. Travel more. Travel everyday? Becoming too routine.


2/24
Translate notes.

去外面。
念書。
起腳踏車。
看makerbarFB。
在光花店買特別的xbox手吧。
試試pinkies up
找遊戲地方
玩跟Simon


The only way to work with the public is Humans? Computers is too limiting， narrowing my focus.

I need more art friends. Contact fine artists. Taipei fine arts. Ultracombos.

Start a new media studio?

Enter art contests. Travel to clear mind and think big and work.

想中文。練習寫字在你的手上面。

Create game club - Facebook. 

Maybe Simon is all I need. Play board games at other places. Need more game and/or travel meetups, social consumption!

在附近我家有公園：
我覺得hackerspace錯的地方。
我也覺得創造錯。
只有電影跟旅行跟社會的東西最好。
也許我不可能平衡。

買便宜的擴音器。

To mandarin: write 20 minutes, 10 minutes CD.

2/26
問我的同學哪天要去miaoli.

To stay alive, you need to be social! You need to explore.

Need more social time. Talk to new and old classmates. Start mandarin games. Start exploring Taipei again? Keep an open mind.

Never go home. Stay out day and night. No reason to be home, unless roommates want to do something. Use hostel as cafe. Or MakerBar, or lechat. Join events, create events, explore. Always be around people. Make friends, don't go to events, unless your intention is to make friends. Live, don't consume media.

Don't leave people. Lead people.

I'm not adventuring enough. Keep wondering and making games. See old ideas. Do new ideas. Always play.

Deepen self into Taiwan, like last time. Get a job then go wild, learning Chinese along the way. The city is yours. Waste time at flea markets, traveling, sleeping wherever. More experience is needed.

There's a barrier between experiencing life and not. Experiencing feelings through real life as opposed to media. Why is it at times I can experience life (biking, exploring) and other times though media (film)?

It's no wonder I slept through school. It's completely uninteresting.

Stay outside. Stay a street kid.

2/28
LOL.

That's better than me. I slept, all day. I think I reached some weird depression. I don't feel bad, but I think I'm narrowing myself to work and not enjoying time off with people or to travel. So, I'll likely stay up and catch a morning train to the east coast, hopefully renew my love for this country.

I guess im trying to push myself in a direction that's kinda less social, less adventurous which i find makes me a boring and lazy person. It's easy to travel, learn languages, open up, be social, but once I start working on ideas that no one in Taiwan cares about, it detracts me from Taiwan and it just sucks to do anything alone. After finishing porting I'll likely limit computers for late night and game club nights, until I find more art friends. As I further myself into work, I miss New York more. It's definitely a good place to settle, work on cool things, and have real friends.

Also I really really need people nearby when I'm sleeping! Effing studio. I'm finding it hard to stay out all night this time. There aren't many cool art events in Taiwan. Perhaps I'm turning back to my former professional / artsy self losing appreciation for the world.

Humans of Taiwan was probably the best thing I could have done to keep me excited about Taipei, and social, so maybe I'll need to start that again (film and travel > computers).

After I come back, I'll likely focus on finding a part time job for money, and reasons to stay out. Maybe even stay at chocolate box on purpose.

Blah! Rant rant. Hah sorry Vin.

二。然後。做我的遊戲。休息外面。

也許我的觀察是最興趣。對。也我跟別的人不可以想一想得好。

起床以後，我想一想很多。

在第一學期我是了性格外向著。我不可了以獨自。我得到了勁從外面來。我有興趣別的人。我也有興趣別的地方。大部分的興趣從人怎麼互動。我有了堅強的情感。雖然我不創造東西，不是，我創造熱的台灣！我覺得人的台灣是我的最高的藝術品！對啊。在外面活給我很多經驗跟勁。我想關於每個人。

我試了感我的path。不是好玩。也我學中文比較不好。我爛了。

在社交的國家人不喜歡工作自己。人很高興。不需要聰明的藝術品還是工作。

我覺得在紐約活比較好因為有很多藝術品的人。我跟他們可以一起工作。

從不較低你的規格。


煩惱較少的。多生活。

忘了電腦的東西，它不供給動機。我需要說話。

你應該想中文，用心的語法。寫字，不擔心。

我決定了，我不寫字。寫字寫得很古。上課完結（？）以後我要忘了。要是我回國，我不練習寫字，我就忘了。每天我不用寫字。雖然寫字可以幫我記。在真的生活用中文比較好。對。

寫很多問題，問我的老師。

我現在懶了。跟Rice我應該說比較多。每天用u-bike去學校。

我現在學被動的。

紐約是最好的地方因為它有很多事件。事件是最好的方法學。

我的腦想得慢慢。我需要小心時間過得快。

看到下個星期的天氣。

自己生活沒有意思。我需要別的人。我的舊的同學也累。

我應該留創造。

不可以看電視。可不可能電腦的工作？我覺得不可能。我太社會的。怎麼了？找別的人？找社會的工作？說話比較多。

旅行給我精力嗎？對。我需要探險。開Humans?忘了你的同學？在外面睡覺。哪裡？挑選地方，然後去。

你應該工作學校裡面。不可以？太性格外向著。你要忘了你說什麼。

裡面沒有意思。我的腦停止。

我怎麼留社會的跟用電腦？坐公車跟火車，旅行，停，工作。

還是Humans。照片。看別的人。留外面。在一天去很多地方。

說很多話。

新的中文manifesto：每天去學校還是自己讀書。學概念。改Alex，你應該讀書然後完。是社會的。晚上寫字。

我跟同學說話的時候我不可以學習。不有用。因為我們學了一樣的書。都要看我。

我要什麼？旅行，創造電影，創造遊戲？

我真的需要旅行。

有人用遊戲學日本。 遊戲是他的激勵。

為什麼你學中文？***** 你跟人需要說話。

我做什麼？旅行？

現在時間快過了。現在沒有

到博客：
選擇一個目標。作。

你忘記了很多，

我覺得城市的人沒有意思。沒有大志。他們生活差不多一樣，所以他們想差不多一樣。你得自己活。

因為你選遊戲嗎？最少的人創造遊戲，也最少的人玩，所以我感到寂寞。

我態度消極。我真的不喜歡活平常的生活。

我丟我的需要社會的生活。

人的臺北是最好的方法說話。

你得看外面。你得旅行。看電影。或有意思的生活。這個東西鼓勵你。

學校最好的，然後Simon然後新天。在臺北留。看電影比較多。

沒有理由留，很像大人，你得去。看時間。練習，工作，朋友。

If media only travels through gossip and TV one could only know local and popular things. Taiwanese people are very gossipy, they only know what's local.

What gives me energy isn't the performance of other people, but their part in the world. I don't really care about people, I care for people in a certain perspective.

怎麼了?

你的工作, 朋友，別的人，世界，你應該關心。

混動，在圖書館，宿舍，公園，外面，工作？ 還是找新的工作。

每個時間，你應該想你現在可以做什麼？

課沒有趣。不可以繼續。我得學自己。關係沒有意思。我感覺，

現在，我沒有上進心（？）。

恢復self-assessment。

跟 simon有工作。好了嘛。

要做:
三：忘記舊的工作。裝作新的。社交的。*****
四：旅行，想起來事。
五：完學校，完Simon的工作
六：下載聽媒體的故事。

臺北： 中文課，simon app，叫英文？在咖啡店還是餐廳上課以後工作為了繼續社交的還是

我很shila說話。我感覺比較好。

如果有些人醒著我好可能說話，完，比較高興。你真的應該住在超克力的宿舍。

我改變了。我變成我的舊的自己。我不是創造的。

我還沒不知道怎麼平衡生活。

我決定了，不可以寫字。寫的時候我想不好。寫字，我替

我決定我不要寫字。這是技術的時代。你的腦學比較慢。下學期你學最快。怎麼了？因為我說的多。現在

這個週末永久的方法。

你真的應該想一想，你要不要學寫字？第一次來台灣的時候你用手寫的字嗎？不對。第二次，也沒有。不有用。

你需不需要別人？你覺得你可不可以學自己嗎？沒關係吧。是否你學你不可能繼續學。

是否上課沒關係。你應該學三個鐘頭，然後別集。上課幫你聽能力。

創造比較多。用新的語法想起來比較多。中文字，拼音，都沒有用。只有一個理由學，就是別人看，比方說老師得正確（？）你的考試。

旅行的時候，認識台灣人，搭便車，坐火車，或是買摩托車。

明天上課，然後去FABLAB還是別的地方-旅行，找房子，找女生，社交的東西。你的問題是起床的時候你得找人，運動。

為了想一想，你得看別的人。不需要跟他運動。

可視，現在，你寫得不有用。保持運動。現在，你勉強活著。去吧。

Blogged:
As an empericist, I've been taught mostly through empiricism. I've read very few books, listened to very few professors, that is, because I am constantly seeking new knowledge, as I do new art, and travel brings about more questions.

Travel isn't about learning a language or a culture, it's about changing the way one thinks because if one stays in one place for a long person of time, one becomes cultured, conditioned to think in a very narrow way....

在飛機場：
小孩子最創造的，愛遊戲的。
三歲小孩子能用手機，照相機。

第二到三天：
看3G的價，搭便車，去

記得買小米禮物。海貝殼？

我覺得日本人比台灣人移動式。日本人坐著想一想。不必外面對它們鼓舞。可以說故事多。他們注意都東西。什麼多重要。好可能導致擔心。社交的時候他們嚐嚐他麼一起消費媒體，作者聊天，作者吃飯。

台灣人不一樣。他們只有生活，玩。

我覺得你可以衡量人的好客以等搭便車多久。臺灣我等了五車。Okinawa我等了三個小時，還車開了不遠。他們真冷。我問他們對我玩笑，反幫忙我要租還是買習慣的時候，他們說不可能，因為只有一個半小時。他們不知道我可以在哪裡買一個。他們也告訴我不可以游泳，因為他們沒有靈活性。

不可以聽說，只有創造。不可以聽說thinking， fast and slow。我寧可寫字，看 wiki，選我讀什麼。

早上的心思：
我想了，不要去紐約。不要工作。工作沒有意思。是機器人的。我應該留台灣，買茶的商店。

個個國家我想要買小的商店所以我總是練習語言。開始連鎖的，不要費太多時間。應該集中哲學。然後買真小的房間，還是用朋友的家。

然後我走著走著看書，沒有問題，運動對我感覺比較好。我看了半個書。


到博客：
在剛來台灣的時候我是真創造的；我愛全世界。現在不是了；我太不創造的，我用媒體。

大部分的人是工作人，機器人的。他們好像現在的我，集中太多。他們不詢問。

在圖書館工作。還是在跟我的朋友工作。

早上：
在 simon的家我起床的時候覺得累極了。我想：為什麼人住在這裡，沒有精力。吧他的家使想起我的老家。

我得找東西對重要。我需要探險。

吧玩遊戲對我麼有意思。我需要某物比較重要：非政府組織，什麼的。

Peter說，他要走一走，好像現代的Socrates。

我覺得我不需要旅行別的國家，台灣夠了。每一個地方有問題。台灣也有沒有錢，家的人。

在 simon的公司的地方，人用電腦工作。沒有意思。沒有人說話。

沒關係。玩工作，告訴simon我的感覺。學語言，在外面走一走，想一想，看電影。

I also kinda came to a realization I made too many friends in Taipei to leave it. I just don't want to restart in another city in Taiwan

I'm still trying to figure out ways to live without computer work

I also came to the realization that I need cites, with tons of events, so that there's always a time to let loose and socialize, physically.

I also think that small spaces are constraining in so many ways. I really need a desk in front of a huge window, with people around.

我有一點怕我自己不可能活。看我的字條，我說真少。我感覺不確定的。

我感覺我學最高第一次來台灣因為我說了真多。如果我不知道怎麼說我就學了。真快我情緒消極。我得記得寫字，想出來，是最好的辦法學語言。每天應該寫唱的故事。

快一點，看電影。
...
我沒看電影反我自己說話。我感覺錶真好。我的重要的問題是我我常忘說話。說話疑惑我總是感覺比較好，

學那一個語言最好的辦法是想出來的運動：說話，寫，想，都一樣。讀，聽，不是想出來的。

5/30
我決定了，我要活簡單的，不要浪費。

6/1
到你的學語言的辦法：
你應該避免翻譯，因為你好可能用比較多新的詞話。創作（說話，寫字，想）應該代替翻譯。

我學會了，我不必聽中文，只有記得用中文創作。聽語言不太重要。

我第一次來台灣雪學了最好的。

看著美國的文關於的百分之一人：
我覺得亞洲人回家的時候要跟家人度過。美國人要做他們的工作（創造的還是生意）。

我覺得走一走，座，旅行最好的媒體。因為你可以想一想，說話。看書，讀書，看快的電影，不可能。真短的書，看wikipedia，看慢慢的電影，說話，去旅行，容易做的工作者，都幫我想出來多。

6/4
我覺得現在的問題是我跟 simon有不一樣的社交的時間。在日間我需要發現，說話。不是，也許不社交的工作使我不好。對了。

我覺得在將來我不要電腦的工作。如果不我自己做，可以，因為我每天不需要去工作室。從不做這麼多。為了別的人不做。
--

在美國的城市，人積極工作，創作。他們沒有生活，所以用媒體替活。

在藝術咖啡店，我感覺到過去的自己。 不需要經歷現實生活，可以自己活用媒體。是比較孤單，合理的。

那一個生活比較好嗎？

我覺得情緒的提醒我最重要是什麼。媒體也可以，可視，如果我生活離問題跟進我更好可能做什麼東西。做，不是，創作，真的做。

夠了。去玩。

從不理由去電影院。如果不遠，好了。

到語言的字條：
應該或普通的生活，然後，你想出來什麼加在你自己的詞話的卡。

我想我臺北的生活。真好玩。不必著急。快要你可以玩。

Old note:
With others I am socially creative, without others I create media.

No purpose to be in the same room as others, except those I have a relationship with. But that would limit creativity.

Feeling a lack of new experiences in class and fablab. I need to travel. Go somewhere new.

6/10
And it's once one stops experiencing, stops to think about experiencing, except happenstance through life or media, that ambition stops and one becomes mechanical.

I stopped learning Chinese, I listen to lectures without direction, I ignore the world.

It's the lack of experience that offices cause that puts me in a work trance.

6/11
現在我想得慢慢，無聊了。我可以創造很大的東西，可是我沒有生活。

到博客：
普通的生活的人怎麼創造很不同的東西？用媒體？總是經歷新的東西？對了。總是說話。然後在晚上做事。

創造什麼？你得小心你選什麼。你得創造什麼藝術有最多的影響。
--

啊，那個話是一樣的，舊的，話。慢慢得時候，你想做什麼比較多，可視做比較少。

對了，在高雄我工作不重要的東西。留在這裡太多久，任何人好可能會忘記什麼事是最重要的。

這一個話也是舊的。

好夠了去做事。

看了一生的照片以後我想我在醫院可以工作。每天跟別的人可以說話，玩。總是有很多人。可視你覺得在裡面你可以總是住，做嗎？

Calvino: Why Read the Classics?:
Italo Calvino proposes that "a classic is a book which has never exhausted all it has to say to its readers."

He writes that "there is no use in reading classics out of a sense of duty or respect."  Instead, "we should only read them for love."

A blog post:
A rational life only covers a small part of the brain, the other part cannot be understood through language, it is pure, a direct vein to the senses; An exploration into the irrational part is a worthy journey.

Life in an office, based on imagination and books is wrong. Empiricism teaches things no book can.

I believe it's possible to condense the knowledge one gets from books to video, and the direction would be fractioned. Humans are visual. The step after visual is interaction.

The entire western philosophy canon can be taught through a few films, given there are pauses or contemplative pacing.

If one could extract the knowledge from the experimental artists in New York, say, Kunal, I think modern philosophy would be greatly broadened.

Another blog post:
Finding experimental communities.

Why did I quickly seek out and find ATA and Berkeley in San Francisco, or Babycastles, NYU ITP, and Parson's MFADT in New York.

And why was I not a part of these communities?

Sheer hedonistic consumption of something new, yet social and physical?

New blog post
What is art and what is worth making in a world full of material?

How does art relate to philosophy?
It is an exploration into philosophy, not an answer, not simply something new, but questions. A provocation of thought and inquiry between the experiencer and the medium.

Experimental artists seek new methods of asking questions, and now, interacting.

Great artists teach philosophy in a context that is more accessible than writing, and often, more fun, powerful, because it is experiential.

John Dewey

101 things I leaned in architecture school:
Engineers tend to be concerned with physical thins in and of themselves. Architects are more directly concerned with the human interface with physical things.
An architect knows everything, an engineer knows everything about one thing.
Science works with pieces of things with continuity presumed, artists works only with continuities of things with pieces presumed.
A good designer is fast on their feet.
A good designer isn't afraid to throw a good idea.
All design endeavors express the zeitgeist.

What are the pros and cons of post-education?

Pros:
Can teach at Universities, but even that reason is following a system, that there is some law that says you must have a degree to teach
Research within my field. Is it worth one's own time and money? What in terms of research will the university provide? Labs, places to experiment, social feedback. Is it worth researching for two years?


Cons:
Will not learn to teach
Will not learn to cope with the real world
Will suppress external senses and interactions
Will limit exploration to a system

開始看Watchmen的時候：
我不要看藝術。我只要跟人做事。只有在晚上可以經歷媒體。為甚麼看電影？我可以幫人，做政治學，創造藝術，真的藝術--表演。

以前我沒看電影因為現實比較重要。藝術的理由是什麼？教？起床人？發現？問問題？為甚麼不只去外面？

怎麼可能看電影？

為什麼我今天到看電影我沒想什麼？你忘了世界。

決定做什麼吧，人的臺灣，開始小集團，回家，政治學。

研究別的小集團。

開始電影集團，遊戲集團，什麼都可以。什麼都應該請。

What I identify myself with Rorschach isn't his black / white psychology, well, some times that, but his unwillingness to stop. He, of the Watchmen, is still alert, knowledgeable of the world, scarred by experiences with it, and because of it, can not stop.

How can one do an office job with nukes pointing at Taiwan. How can one stand by as cross straits relations close in. How can one do nothing of slums, the prostitution? Perhaps Taiwan is too soft. Not arousing enough. Taiwan's arousal only leads to art. I want more. The difference between the poor and rich is not enough. Or is it?

On the other side, how does one maintain a state of grace, rational, like Veidt, do the homework, routine, plan, avoiding hedonism, leading others?

I think I can, now. But once I go back on the streets, the world will distract me.

From Eric Hoffer's biography:
A long shoreman philosopher.

Montaigne's essays effected him.

A passionate obsession with the outside world or the private lives of others was an attempt to compensate for a lack of meaning in one's own life.
