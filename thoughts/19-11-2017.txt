A room in a friend's house on a mountain, cold and rainy outside. The room reminds me of San Francisco: cramped. The room, only used for sleeping and computer-ing. Once I get to the computer, I just sit and think with a blank stare at the screen, or, consume more life via media (music to aid thinking), but leave the computer otherwise untouched.

I'm not supposed to be here. What I want to do doesn't require me being in front of a computer.

I want to be in the warmth, the warmth of the city, with its cultural tastes, people, life (in the artificial and reality). I want to be with people, in the same space, sharing, exploring the world around. I want to be in the Factory. I want to be on the streets of cities, sipping on red tea.

I want to be free again, with the city taking care of me, and me taking care of it...
