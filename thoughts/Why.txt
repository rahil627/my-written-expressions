# Why?
1. direct reaction to watching Evo / ‘eSports’, figuring out what was wrong with it (beyond capitalism stuff)
2. a retrospective answer

## 1
It’s just silly that in 2018, the people who love and play video games competitively aren’t reciprocated with games that respect them; And further, almost no new forms (save a few un-polished indie games). Every fighting game played at Evo 2018 [and most contemporary competitive games for that matter], with the exception of *Super Smash Bros. Melee*, is an ancient *SF* clone. And that left me to ponder *why?*. Why do players continually rely on ancient game publishers for new games, when, since at least the early 2000s, game development became far more accessible to individuals? Why wait for old game corporations, or even small independent game developers, when the community has the man-power not only to make their own games, but update it, decide its trajectory, and maintain it themselves? The communities have already done everything else by theirselves; This seems to be the last part that’s not in their own control: the games.

In the history of popular fighting games, *at least* two seem to have stood the test of time: *Street Fighter 3: Third Strike* (and Garou?) for traditional fighting games and *Melee*. In the history of popular competitive games, most have strayed toward technical distractions instead of, well, *fighting*—adapting and re-adapting to the opponent’s habits. It’s now 2018. In a world with this many people with this much development, people still must play old games? No one can even go back and perfect their old favorites? People still mindlessly wait for and purchase re-hashed, more flawed games from big game corporations every release cycle? Has nothing changed since 1992? I don’t want to believe that...But it’s true: We are left with an accumulation of imperfections without the source-code to maintain them.

Of the companies of the games at Evo, the only companies that even have a relationship with their communities are Iron Galaxy (of Killer Instict, beginning from Season 2[?], and known porting games like SF3 with good net-code) and *maybe* Arc Systems. They actually update their fighting game system, attend tournaments, get feedback, and change. The others merely follow an ancient Japanese business model: abuse intellectual property and update the production, similar to the Hollywood income model; Though okay for fanboys, it’s really disrespectful to competitive players.

Actual anarchy, social organizing, whether at commune level or settlement level is tiring. Communes come up and go down, as does the energy. It’s natural. But, you know what doesn’t? *People who play fighting games*: fighting game culture. Whatever happens in life, it seems I can always rely on hanging out to play games with friends. Somehow, it’s just really stable. More stable than any co-living situation I’ve been in with people with a hippie culture. Surely there will be high and low times within the FGA, but, really, I just don’t see this falling to the trappings of living together. [todo: worth thinking more about: why...]

# The part that’s really really sad
Instead of creating games from scratch, technical people from the game communities have instead seem to have approached the tech backwards, spending more time cumulatively then perhaps all of the original game developers combined, ever. Even now people hack and emulate their favorite game systems with their favorite fighting games (extremely arduous and wholly unneccesary) because the game developers (usually Japanese game companies for traditional fighting games) hold their source code dearly (or perhaps stuck in copyright limbo?), without an ounce of care for the communities that have formed; The people who continually purchase the products (game systems, games, input devices), continuously throwing their money toward game system manufacturers, receive nothing in return of their purchases. The game companies receive wealth while the game communities (the people who play and spread the game’s culture) struggle to make tools to play, inspect, and modify their favorite games, which were written in cryptic programming languages which themselves interact with even more cryptic hardware devices. Those poor poor yet passionate un-sung game community “technicians”. Sad, yet inspiring, in a very specific-passionate Grizzly Man sort of way...

# my Hunches [incomplete]
I’m not sure of the underlying reasons for all of this, but I think it’s worth investigating elsewhere.

[A few guesses: Newly developed indie games just don’t catch on as they should, being stuck in inner cities within tiny communities. People are stuck to traditional fighting game and game ideas, unable to adapt. The corporate games are in the media air-waves, and now investing even more money into their own products via eSports. Making fighting games is not easy, or, is so painful, that only high-wage laborers would do it.]

[money, politics, ideology, convenience, etc.]

This project banks on that last hunch. Maybe there’s really a problem with making games. Maybe the game frameworks suck. Maybe all consoles suffer from bad internet code and bad internet hardware devices. Maybe only Japanese-cultured people have the ability to finely balance and hone a fighting game system. I don’t really know, but I’m willing to check it out.
