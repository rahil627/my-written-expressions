Japan day 2;
Japan is terrible.

Developed vs developing societies / cultures
Developed:
Material-oriented
Cares about end result (product, urban planning, urban development)
More likely to fall for cultural mannerisms due to obedience to authority (clothing, permission from authority)
Media-oriented (likely to use smartphone everywhere)
Works for corporations (chain stores, tech corps)
Does not care for others, due to being too busy working
Works without knowing why, following what society desires (including what capital wants)
Extremes are suburbia and endless beauracracy (Kafka, Japan, South Korea)

Developing:
Experience-oriented
Cares about the experience of doing (lack of high-quality urban development)
Does not care for things past survival (house quality, food quality)
Talking-oriented (likely to move with friends everywhere)
Works for one's self (food stand, DIY repairs, DIY survival, individual businesses)
Cares for individuals and their livelihoods
Works only to get by (although cares for social / material problems, often too content with one's own life to worry or do anything further)
Extremes are over-content, simple life, no desire for development (islands such as orchid island, a aboriginal towns in east and south Taiwan, S.E. Asia)
