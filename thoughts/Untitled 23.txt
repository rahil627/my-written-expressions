Yo.

Though I’m not particularly excited about the product, remote / QA / part-time work is a rare gig that I don’t mind. Plus, I’m probably in a similar position to the CEOs: living happily in our own beloved parts of Asia and getting by; I’m in Taiwan. And, if things go well, then this could be quite good, especially for this upcoming season—dry season.

I haven’t touched programming for ages, but if y’all are happy with some automated QA tools, I’m pretty sure I’ll figure out some workflow. (Though I pray that “kiosks” aren’t on special devices...)

Although I can code, I really hope the work sticks to QA, some bug fixing, tests, etc. I personally never keep up with technology (web, server, OS, all of it) like that. I normally only do programming for some sort of artistic goals (installation art, game art, etc.).

If QA is the deal, I’ll happily try...I just have to turn this surf shack into an office now...and retrieve my electronics...
