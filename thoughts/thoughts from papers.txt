next sheet:
Tainan day 2:
thoughts:
Feel super relaxed. Have scooter, food, not fighting. Sleeping during the day. Beach (just 10 minutes away). Climb / parkour. No care for others’ thoughts.

It feels like San Francisco, the second time. Calm. Go out (good food, seems hippy, smug) during the day at may own pace. A nobody. No deep social relations. Wander the city / nature. Create by myself.

I thought, the opposite of Taipei / New York — fighting for social development / injustice. Being aware vs not. Seeing the lives of others, the struggle, vs not. Is it the comfortable whether? Not sure. Still, not as creative-inducing as the east coast and perhaps south; where I am not stuck in a small space - rather, the entirety of the are is open for creating. Materials everywhere. Space too.

Not as social, fun, performative, conversational, political, fun, as NY [or any city], or even hostels in Taiwan. **Not as fun as Xiaoxiao**. Maybe she **is** my New York. All that I love of NY, not Taiwan: **hostel travelers, not digital designers.**

papers written in Yilan:
paper 1:
todo: observe east coast societies

Yilan:
Walking in the morning, my mind thinks, wanders. The space, the comfort, the lack of distraction, lack of social forces; I miss it. This freedom to think about the world, to not follow others — to create my own direction. Though, being social here, and forcing people / politics, I may one to the same problems*, once I am more aware.

* I surely lost a lot of awareness of problems when I moved to the city. Cities are awful, especially in bad weather. It’s difficult to tay stable without trapping oneself in a small space.

Luodong is very taiwanese, a great night market, streets / urban planning, more Taiwan culture than Taipei, even Taipei’s neighborhoods can’t replicate this feeling.* Cities feel like a different country.
  - old thought: New York is nothing like the rest of America.

*I need the city because I need organizations toward art and science. It is one of the few places I can cooperate to help society. NGOs are another. Schools too. Medicine. City planning. It’s possible I feel less close to others outside of a city too. The urban planning is so spread out, or: I am failing to be social / productive to the community. Perhaps travel books helped me become aware of problems, and even gave knowledge of the world.

But even when I travelled, many experiences were with knowledgable people — hostel owners, travelers, help exchange, organizations, university-educated kids. I still fail to teach.* I still fail to do things alone. I need the city because organizations toward certain things exist.

I didn’t feel this way at first. Upon coming here I had plans to just be myself, and allow my direction to pervade to others. All that I blogged about — materials, technology, etc. To entice others to come to me — a public place. All i need to do was to express myself; and to do that *I wanted, not needed, my own space — not a library or hackerspace, my space, and from the public space to my private space.

Need a Taiwanese roommate for Chinese practice / happiness, just be selective with social time? As I did in American cities? Really losing my ideals, ethics, to social forces. I need a home. The meeting Place was not bad, with fridges, clothes dryer, supermarket food, but too many social forces toward non-productive things — or perhaps I felt production in the past because my goal was to learn Chinese [and travel / explore], and I was also creating via Humans of Taipei.

It now seems it may not be worth living outside of Taipei. Jemas said he can find a place for 2000. that’s the absolute minimum. In taipei it may be between 4000-9000 for a room in a shared apartment or suite. What’s $100-200? I’d rather eat vegetables and rice, making better decisions on purchases. It simply is not worth living outside of Taipei. The cost only matters in getting space for a family to raise, or, living closer to nature.* Even here, space can be found in the public because the public is crime-free. A small residential park may be enough for the moment, but near a mountain / natural park would be much better. Is being 30 minutes away from nature wrong? Perhaps I feel this way because in College Park, nature began from my back yard.
— (end of paper 1)


paper 2:
continued:
Other than living peacefully on the East Coast, what can be gained? Will nature inspire me? Will it allow me to create more?* Allow me to consume more information and organize it into art?* Similar to those artists that live in isolation — Walden, Tolstoy?

The creation is different — media vs experience.***

The difference between living in a dense area and a non-dense area is that in the dense one there is a choice of being with others.**** And many people don’t seem to respond the same to information (message), as opposed to reality (material, physical).

And vice versa: (media vs experience) affects people differently. Media is good for knowledge / philosophy. Experience is good at causing people to do things.***
-

Back to the original goals — public space, city planning with tech, decision-making (Taizhong was quite interest because the problems were so clear), create tech from local materials (create art from local material combos), medicine, games for education?, progressive classes to teach (game, film, outside, media, family), politics, political media — film, cognitive science, social science.

Perhaps will just have to observe east coast societies, determine what should be developed, ask government for money (to live and pay off debt), propose solutions (with tech), expose problems — in planning, culture, etc., join local organizations.

Play with materials, craft, tech, space, play.
-

Live on a rooftop, project a film (or just in a public space), politically vandalize, force out bad decisions — political / social, encourage safety and survival, ignore laws, the world is yours**, but it only feels like mine if there are people around. None of these public acts matter if no one is around. I need the city. No act is useful in a society where the acts make no sense to the community. Work is needed in less developed societies, but I desire to do higher level work. It is not satisfying to do any less (of course I can learn from anything), but it feels better to be near my full capability.

papers written during time in Taipei for 3 months:
paper in pencil [paper with drawing of public place in an apartment complex]:
crossroad city comics and urban planning, experience the city and read Jane Jacobs and Christopher Alexander
illustrate urban problems

time and space:
experience in a place / area builds an attachment, like the love for a city. I love tonhua, but not the rest. Because I haven’t had experience [experienced the rest?].

What about nature? Hot springs, gorges, mountains, rivers, waterfalls? Perhaps Taidong is better. Or inner rift valley?

Effects of music and exercise on mind and decision-making. To live in a city is to move between spaces and talk to people. But why move when you can stay in one place? Because you would miss the real experience.

[drawings of maps]
(drawing one: a typical Chinese park neighborhood, with a flag off of a room on the second floor
drawing two: the front side of three story apartments, the storefront on the first floor, and a sign on the railing of a roofs)
  - [these were possible spaces]

As long as there is space in front of the place, it should feel good to live in, lively to walk around. the sign does not matter. People will come. I can’t rely on past experiences, nostalgia*. I have to move on. Create my own place. If the front part is ugly, can clean and fix myself to allow more light. Have to think about modifiability.

notes on the side of paper:
old neighborhoods with a market
balcony / park storefront
  - street is okay if in neighborhood, just not noisy

but this can make it feel uninviting to the public, because they don’t use the internet, they just window shop, more aware, less focused.

physical attitude does not matter. Just location / accessibility. People use internet to feel / attend events to talk, no matter where, as long as one hour or closer.

three papers in blue ink:
extra paper:
Rethink the search for a home:

East Coast community: essentials and computer for work. Everything else is excess. 
  - Pure functional work. Small community. Survival and internet connection, more materially creative.
    - can do happily, becomes excess in the city. Production is excessive, so that it becomes a problem in decision-making, education, and policy.
  - Neighborhood in City: Adds more complex[?] community, more political* (decision-making at a higher level), larger problems, more complex problems, more distraction, more diversity? (not really, for Taiwan), more shared economy, more people (can use media), more social? (more shallow?), less materially creative.

paper 1:
continued from yesterday:
Perhaps a reason I failed during my time in Taiwan (this time) is because I have a belief: I can live off the community — gift economy, share food, share housing. the problem is when I want to go in my own direction (example: own housing), suddenly, it feels no one is there. It is difficult to ask friends for housing. Space is a commodity. Space is an incoming for tousim. It becomes a shame to ask for housing as it does to sleep in the public of a city. This, plus the inability to manage homeostasis without air conditioning (and a shower?) made it very difficult to live in Taipei.
  - read this to rethink of reason one
  - this is the paradox
    - like Wall-E, I need that bit of organization, that space to hide from storms, exercise, and maintain health, and personal belongings.

home vs homeostasis:
I chose to find a house first, but I should have chosen to work first, then ask for sharing a house. But isn’t that the same as a shared apartment? I guess what I am against is the idea of owning land.
->
And so I also had strong feelings to live on the east coast first. A place where I can maintain homeostasis and be myself. I just need air conditioner and space. Why is that so difficult, in a place with so many buildings? How many times was I asked or even in argument to be inside such a space?

La Savage[?] seems more human than a civilized being, then what does that say about civilization? Is that just my view? A childish one?

When people see me sleeping in a park, a bench, a playground, near an air conditioner, beneath a bridge, is there no compassion in the passerby’s, or do they think I enjoy it? Is my long hair not a sign of homelessness? Are there too many homeless people to worry about? There is little difference between a traveler and a homeless person in appearance. If I were a girl with a backpack, would it increase my chances of being helped? Is it because I am old? How do people know that I don’t know better? The helping hand has disappeared recently. Instead, it takes money.

paper 2:
continued from first paragraph:
2. Perhaps I just wanted to see reality, but not affect it yet, but failed to maintain physical health, mostly due to a lack of wealth.

1. I come with many ideas, ideas based on past positive experiences. This crashed in my face. I thought I could find a space and build a community, but the common view of space is that it has a cost - AirBnB, hostels, deny people without money. But if one explains the situation face to face, people understand*, and become more human. So, people assume that a person without money is useless to them, not giving a chance, especially when not physically proximal. There is an infinite amount of information in physical appearance and the way one communicates.*

I failed to convey myself. If I showed my interest in the culture, people, being a part of society, their view of me becomes positive, and that is when hospitality comes. Perhaps they want something too; to learn via a physical social setting. But I cannot always think this way, I want to[?]

There does seem to be a this waste of time talking, as opposed to doing, especially when compared to America / private sector society. People [here] just want to talk. More sociology, philosophy, etc., but no practical efforts to increase human survival, no practical art, no expression, burst of feeling. Perhaps they only write it down rationally, or with cute stickers.
  - [perhaps a problem of education? Or limits of social, culture, economic spheres?]

1. ? forgot
2. just want to consume, see other’s view, compare societies, as opposed to work, whatever that may be [/ mean]
  -> society, books, thinking, watching, decision-making

school children at 7-11, studying, growing up in a city, not sheltered at home


— (end of three papers in blue ink)

a tiny scrap:
the city at least pushed me to do something.

the house restricts action, creativity, design, social life, fun. There is nothing here except the descriptions of the world by other people. No experience.

I must move on, knowing that I waste resources in my future, be a part of the … [abrupt end / unfinished].

days later:
to theorize reality, use Limits to Capital, Jane Jacobs, Christopher Alexander.

I enjoy creating theory from observing life. Active [action?], causality, culture, deacons travaton [?]. I also enjoy creating ideas for design.*
  - to do this I must continually live, likely in the city, part of society and family.

a paper from 6/11:
The heat is uncomfortable. It influences me to eat rather than exercise. Really need to control heat.

And old thought: Awareness depends on consumption through senses and rational. Walking through a street everyday creates a social structure in one’s mind. That is a large part of culture. That also creates a sense of home, and later, a belonging, which when away one misses.

Tonghua joe was my home, but now that I am inside a dull building, it does not feel like the Taiwan I experienced. I need the neighborhood.

I need to talk again.

A person can affect reality socially and materially, both can be an experience, material is uncommonly interactive, so social re* *ve action from the participant.

History, cognitive science, have proposed * *inking of causes.

* denotes ripped paper


a paper, describes a dream of which my desires at the time exist in:
need to be up at night to dream of a different world

exercise and heat / homeostasis and decisions / homeostasis and force?
*backpack slowed me down. Need to be mobile. Begin to run today.
yesterday’s thoughts continued:
[blank]
today’s thoughts:
I had a dream while listening to music and running. I protested against building a large building in my neighborhood [in Taipei]. The day I went, stood in front of the planned site, stood there with my arms crossed (a Taiwan gesture for no). I stood, people noticed, and began to protest in their own ways. (Later, I argued with people, that this was not because / to act this way). I told them, I only jump-started what in everyone’s head. I also argued that their actions were more creative than most media from countries where people are able to live without worry for survival. I stood, day and night. For the night, I built a wooden strutter to hold me up, as I slept, in the no gesture position. …Later, Pan helped translate questions from the public. …Later, after its success, I leveraged my fame to do more — market safety, helmets, factories, housing. It felt free, freedom. Using all means. Ignoring all customs, like running through the city in the night I dreamt all of this.


a paper, describes a desire to be a part of society without money from an experience of being homeless in Taipei:
Why did it take so long for me to get moquito spray?
  - Because I had one in my pack? Because I thought heat was the problem? Why didn’t I sit near the air conditioner at Wellcome the first time? Social norms and its problems.
    - [The city is inhuman, ruthless about property.]

Why don’t I exercise anymore? No work, not sure what to work on? Well, first I thought I should get a cheap apartment and live miserly, like then at The Meeting Place.
  - can do this anywhere. The sacrifice is the experience. I wanted to a build a community, feel free, not focus and work, but rather be aware and help around, as opposed to creating media in the past.
    - [I wanted to live, not merely interact with and create material]
  - I just wanted my own space, yet within the reach of a community, and allow people in it. Then with people change the space outside together. But first, I need that space.
  - I need to live minimalistically to be myself. To store water, tea, rice, and leftovers. I’ve already wasted enough trying to survive the heat, urban planning, and mosquitos. Just a space with air conditioner [or fan and water] would be enough.
  - But I also wanted to talk to people. Learn the language. Learn the people.
  - Without people do I focus too much on the material? The focus should be people. Politics. [Tech is crossed out]. Social.


some random old papers from physical notepad:

another note page [from Taipei]:
1. protest games
2. decorative arts? Protest - all gone. Should have filmed the experience.
4. DIY Space - maps, materials, direction, Taiwan crafters / location, news to civil disobedience
5. Taiwan indie games - platemaking events, creation / workshop events

business ideas:
squat snorkel trip advisor
square blue island tour guide

another note page:
think as I did at Parson’s.*

idea list from home:
[maybe from Zizek video or film]
[I selected bits of it]
lots of ideas
people from developed countries fear many things
fascism is at it’s most, conservatist[?] a revolution that manages[?] / reassures a hierarchal society
ideology - filter, frame

capitalism, instability, isolation, solution, explain it

as multitude of fears, to make it easy, blame one things - Jews, easier to react to, solution is clear

forget the past, and live in the present!
  - act on now.
  - to live without language, act based on experience
  -> post-academic organization
  - no need to argue, the proof is reality*

another note:
[maybe Zizek video continued]
conservative - judge, police, etc. “acting is something you cannot put into words” - even more brutal

he’s not screwed up

fantasy is a lie, covers inconsistency, when one doesn’t understand, proves an easy answer

[Taxi Driver]
victim not acknowledge is one
->
U.S. military -> violence, Vietnam, etc. -> impotence, lack cognitive mapping

[The Searchers]

(Braud’s manifesto? [maybe unibomber])
Osb bomb - not personal insanity, reaction to confusion, like Travis’s killing spree

What in yourself, change you? Entice you to the lulling[?] ideology

todo list from home:
[I selected bits of it]
the city as art, culture, etc.
non-digital creativity

another todo list:
[I selected bits of it]
1. experience and design guide before later designing[?]
2. write before reading
  - essays on knowledge
  -> draft all thoughts
  -> rewrite in a personal way, or Bacon
3. read / experience at night

physical exam in Taiwan

a todo list:
1. get out, can’t survive without experience.
  - watch films to survive at home
  -> make selling things priority
  -> regain activity
2. sell expensive things, buy things I only can in America, pack, get ticket / apply to residences and schools.
3. passport, motorcycle license, driver’s license, health report from Taiwan

could take time to read, watch films, go over thoughts (age 22-27, 5 years)

Amnesty International
UNICEF
NGOs
progressive schools
use film to advocate?
game?


papers written at home or even older:

half a paper:
The distance between humans does not only lead to isolation and therefore inequality[?] (social status[?]).

It also results in less exposure to creativity and chances to display creativity. Without people, there is no one to perform for, share with.

To be depressed of watching life is [sentence cuts off].

You have to keep thinking about society / people.
  - a film, a real society, a family[?], whatever

*Doing something in the public makes it seem okay for society to do so.
  - [mmm, doing something in the public makes it feel morally okay to do.]
  - not doing anything in the public makes society isolated.
    - [i think what I meant was: not doing things in a public space results in an isolated society]
