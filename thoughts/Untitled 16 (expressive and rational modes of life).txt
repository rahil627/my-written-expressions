Ahhhh...Having a home...a comfortable home...is great.—But, is it really just the air condititions?, humidity and temperature, that make it comfortable? Is that it?

When I’m cold, I must keep drinking hot water or a hot caffeinated drink to have energy, which leads to, often, writing, because it’s the quickest way, and, with the caffeine, I’m able.

When I’m hot, I must keep moving, wandering, drinking ice-cold tea, staying alive, talking, expressing myself, libido high, need sex, need someone to actively have sex with me, need to keep interacting, with people and the world.

But when I’m comfortable...I’m dead. Hollow. Is this really the beginning of instrumental rationality, as opposed to constant thinking / living in the moment / conscious and attentive of what’s around? *Instrumentally rational cultures* — Jews and Jew-likes — vs *expressive cultures* — Black Americans and Gypsy-likes?

During the *expressive mode of life*, one has to wade through capitalism, ‘huckin’ and jivin’, trying to ‘stay alive’ while living through performance. Black entertainment. Gypsy music and dance. Busking. Art-ing. Art-life. **We have to constantly express ourselves, yet, find a ways to live whilst doing it.** It’s a difficult life. Capitalism doesn’t match. Neither do heart-less people. Performance spaces and good public spaces are needed to keep such people healthy. The culture has nourish them...

During the *instrumentally rational mode of life*, one’s end-goal is capital, and thus world-views are shifted by the lens of capital. Ignorant of the damaging means.

Often, under capitalism and freedom, one goes in and out of both modes, or, even tries mixing them. ‘Commercial art’. Or even just genuine art that is objectively capitalistic (trying to gain more capital) without much conscious of it. **We live, we express, but often, those things can get mixed up with capital.** *It happens. It just happens.*

**To live genuinely is to constantly express one’s true intentions, through communication or action.** Always doing what’s on one’s mind (unless, that mind is corrupted...). **This state of mind is true life.**

**Capitalism disables us** acting in such a way, and, in some places, even communicating in such a way. One can’t do what one wants due to laws, institutions, and, mostly, lack of money. Thankfully, the mind keeps going, free. Until they get that 1984 tech to read minds.

Although capitalism disables us from, perhaps, certain forms of hedonism that requires capital, it can’t stop us from expressing ourselves in the most basic human ways: language, song, dance, performance. **We write, we sing, we dance, we live, by expressing ourselves; All of that, without capital.**

**Human expression requires so little: time, good health. The rest is up to us.**
