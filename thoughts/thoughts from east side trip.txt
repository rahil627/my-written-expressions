There were a few important theories that I thought of recently, hopefully my mind re-collects them:
The most recent one was that:
$$$$$**An isolated environment, f.e. suburbs, motorcycle-centered-urban areas (台東市), all lose culture because cultures’ spaces are pushed to private, enclosed spaces. An interactive environment, f.e. walkable urban areas, maintain cultures because culture is available in the public spaces.**

**The isolated environment, though maintains culture within an enclosed space, will gradually add popular media to its own culture.**

That is why isolated places, f.e. aboriginal villages, new sparsely populated areas, are more susceptible to consuming Western pop media than interactive places.

**It is through public interaction that culture is passed.**

I saw a video of Nujabes playing a flute with Uyama playing an alto sax, a tribute video by his Hyde-Out members, read his Wikipedia, and Google mapped and imaged Kamakura.

Seems as if he simply took a break from the record store he owned in Shibuya, went to Kamakura beach, and just began chilling, playing; a very similar circumstance to mine.

His prime years were from 2003 to 2005; He was 29 to 31 years old.

To make that kind of music, it requires a bit of detachment. Nature, music-making; pushing politics and the world aside.

...But Japan is super-detached anyway.

Peaceful ocean, calm winds, makes one sleepy, it’s so comfortable. It reminded me of Nepal; Being at peace in comfortable weather. Taiwan really lacks comfortable weather. It has to make up for it with convenient stores, and tea via plastic packaging.

A lazy day, but all I could do after starving yesterday, and not receiving enough sleep due to the mosquitos, increased by the lack of wind.

I stumbled upon a perfect place to pitch a tent, but, it turns out, as before in Japan, that the grass is fake, extremely shallow. That experience reminded me that I should buy a standard tent from the shop in Taiwan. Then I wouldn’t need an apartment, or use time looking for one. It would allow me to remain anarchic.

After that experience I felt that Taiwan was indeed over-populated, developed, and should take a trip to Indonesia, or, other more nearby natural parts of the world. Also, that I still have to explore Taiwan’s mountains.

I read quite a bit of Donald Trump’s Wikipedia today. I haven’t really thought much since I saw that he was elected on the television in a highway rest station in Japan. He’s simply a capitalist. He inherited wealth, invested that in property and branding, produced a TV show to show his face, and forced himself into media making himself a celebrity, like Paris Hilton: another real-estate inheritor. Trump is a sheer capitalist. The absolute opposite of tradition and nature.

That reminded me: property is still a contemporary force in livelihood. People must pay for property to place themselves in a place that they desire. And it reminded me that i should continue avoiding paying for property and invest in a tent, scooter care, car. Fuck property.

But at $200/month in the center of the city, it’s not so bad in Taiwan.

It also reminded me that it’s the capitalists that build buildings, apartments. To avoid it all, one simply must just not live buildings that they built. But when it comes to living in an urban environment, then there is no choice. Well, almost: car, camp, commute from nature.

from a the few scrap papers I wrote on today:
a scrap:
Such a good day: woke up naturally, stood in the sun, on the beach, took a quick shower, then naturally began to work. Then, the dude at the library gave me coffee! Woo!

a scrap:
Walkable city as home, culture, etc. Need it. To find work without a computer. To have sensible people around. [To have a home.]
  - Tabei, city
    - dependent, but a good life. [People are direct, pay money, easier to make social contracts]
Though, a single-building home / community isn't bad either. Just need people.
  - NSX
    - [though] still need an apartment
    - [feel] freer, hippie life, independent

a scrap:
perfect day to beg for work

a scrap:
some thoughts from earlier:
**in the end have to do what rich people pay for.** In Taiwan's culture, that's making and selling food. For old money, that's spa resorts / hotels, standard restaurants, up-scale down-town bars and massage parlors catered to the rich business-people, etc. Except, perhaps, foreigners / hipsters; Hence, my desire for New York and big cities: there is no culture or market for anything else.

a scrap perhaps from yesterday:
stay in extremes:
nature home
city performance / work / sell
  - performing and selling are hippie / indie
  - work is with a company or another person, thus requires creating a social contract
    - [this is] good in America, but terrible in Taiwan 
avoid all people. Get the money and get out: fuck them all. No point of politicking!

Well, that week went by quick. Good weather throughout. Good sleep. Nightly towel-baths. Healthy. Unconscious. Completely unconscious. Habituated.

And that's how it happens. One becomes habituated to waking, eating, sleeping, without thinking about how and what one eats, about the air conditioner, about the water cooler, and all those things that keep the body in homeostasis. Thus, although Asia, and especially Taiwan, can be uncomfortable due to the humidity or high heat, it keeps one's mind on the weather, and, often, on the environment.

I was mindlessly wandering Wikipedia after seeing the word Cascadia, a *bioregion* of northwest Americas. I was a bit conscious of it, so perhaps not entirely mindless, but still, quite so. Anyway, that lead to thinking about ideal places, in America, then in the World; Perusing 'most walkable cities" articles. New York, San Francisco, Montreal, Florence, Venice, Fez, Asian old towns, etc. Looking at the map of San Diego, seeing the vast suburbs, I just could not fathom living in America, or, at least, that part of America, which is, no different from the part of America I grew up in: Virginia Beach.

It's just so different from Taiwan, where one can be in a different environment -- rural, mountain, beach, city, town -- all just often 30 kilometers away. Outside of the city centers of America seem so drag. The Bay Area, outside SF, was terrible, for those few days I explored it, before going back home. The same went for New York, except that it occurred within the same city: outside of Brooklyn and perhaps parts of Queens, it was a terrible environment. One has to keep one's mind on those few beautiful bits of the city: good neighborhoods, friend's places (their homes and/or the places they made, such as communities), ethnic enclaves, etc. Outside of that, is that bland suburb or city suburb created by capitalist behavior. There is no sight of freely-acting human behavior outside of those few areas.

Now, here in Taidong, Taiwan, I feel as if it was a bland American city: a dead, un-walkable city area with people only commuting to it from their far away homes. I miss the old cultural neighborhoods and towns, especially of Taipei's, and of New York's. It is only within the huge cities that diverse minds, and therefore diverse cultures exist. Elsewhere, it feels one must rely on media to make-up for that lack of physical diversity.

Suburban minds are diverse by the amount of information they have consumed through media; Urban minds are diverse by the amount of real information / experience consumed through living in the city. One can watch a Jia Zhangke film and obtain a lot of information. Or, one can walk through New York, or, travel through China, and obtain a lot of real information.

The city is great because it's a cooperative effort to build a good environment, constantly shaping and shifting it. In Taidong, or the suburbs, one simply creates a good environment in the physical constraints of their property. The city is public. The suburban home is private. Normally. One *could* transform their suburban home into a public community or business, just as many good hostels in Taiwan have.

And that, may be just the way to go. To build communities in nature.

Listened to some Pitchfork new album music. It's all so immature, limited in content. Jay-Z on 4:44, at his old age, finally becomes conscious of blood diamonds, but fails to see the work that goes into producing alcohol bottles, instead, his attention is focused on how black Americans are owning businesses. Before that, I was browsing around for some anarchic rap, anarchic music, and anarchist artists. It's mostly just folk / punk, like 阿莊.

I also felt it was so insular, relying on the consumption of media, with several media references. America is so unconscious of everything. Taiwan is way ahead. An earlier thought: the aboriginals of Taiwan have an American culture. They unconsciously consume whatever is given, and do whatever to get by, ending up with expensive cars and listening to hip-hop music too. But, unlike America, these people have little to no education. What does that mean for America's education?

Ahhh, found a cup of coffee a the observation deck, which should be titled 'smoking deck'. Listening to Final Fantasy X-2 piano arrangement. I'm in utopia again. I have energy again! The heat and coffee did wonders. Like the  smokers, I took a huge breath of fresh air as soon as I got out of the air-conditioned airport. Such happiness. Such simple happiness. Now, I think of the world. I imagine everything: all possibilities. It's such a bliss to imagine.

I dream again, of having a home in some idyllic place not far from 台東市. Telling all of the foreigners that I have found balance in life, and can lead the to it too, if they so desire to stay in Taiwan, as I do, via a mass Facebook message.

2/9/2017 at Hong Kong (HKG) airport for a visa run
Another great part of Taiwan's culture is reducing waste. This allows anyone to scavenge from anyone: people going in buffet restaurants to grab the wasted food, the scavenging ladies that sweeping (scanning and fetching) urban areas, the scavenging guys that ride their scooters sweeping parks, restaurants ethically ridding wasted food and drinks, trying not to make any more than is consumed. This leads to people allowing others to ask to take and eat the vegetables and food that cannot be sold.

This also keeps reducing waste in one's attention. At first, the country seems crazy to spend so much attention on it, seeming extreme in many ways. Why sort recycling so much when it's their snack culture that creates it? Just stop buying snacks in plastic and bring a tin container and steel bottle! Why wash clothes by hand when there are cheap washing machines that do the work just as well? Much of it is simply un-thinking, cultural-following habits. It's a strange contradiction to see: people wasting and recycling so much.

But at least there's still attention to it.

--
I feel that I mentioned this before: I like Taiwanese culture because they are aware of the materials, the work, the effort, put into everything. They see it all. At a shop, they don't simply see the goods, they see the entire historical organizational human work to bring it all together. They appreciate everything, constantly saying 厲害 at anything. Though a seemingly meaningless compliment at first, at least they notice it, pay attention to it. **Taiwan's culture's attention is everywhere, and I love it because it is.**

Often it's on primitive things: food, weather, bodily functions; Or, cultural things. But it's also on every kind of person, any kind of place, anything. **Attention to everything and anything. That's what makes a good culture good. Contrarily, bad cultures focus on media, mediated communications -- not reality.** This is why most East Asian cultures are so narrow (Japan, Korea), and why American-like cultures (蘭嶼, Philippines, Indonesia) area so American -- their attention is focused on media, not everything.

When one's attention focuses on everything, the environment comes into view -- a plant, an animal, nature. **More and more is focused on over time. This is education -- to take the world in slowly, at one's own pace.**

Perhaps the harmony meme is a component of this: letting people live and learn at their own pace.



--
The greatest social problems are a matter of attention.

Attention drifts away from the environment as soon as one is in an air-conditioned environment, void of all natural elements, able to focus one's attention on whatever: information, communication within one's own social network, capital, etc. The holistic care for everything disappears. The collective battle to make the world a better place disappears too. These air-conditioned places have doomed the world.

Every experience at the airport is different, because my state of mind, attention is different.

In the past, I remember often just being super-aware of the environment, wondering how such a huge place was built, how humans have developed all of this shit, how humans have lost humane-ness to run it.

I remember wondering about where each person came from, their hometown, the environment that's in their mind, their everyday work. I used to be curious of humans. I remember being happy to see humans from nice places, such as Nepal. Sharing my love of their hometown and foodstuffs. It's so easy to spot people who come from good places in the world.

Now, I'm not thinking much, because I despise them all, from the robotic airport workers to corporate workers to wealthy ignorant people. **I just want my hippies, farmers, and nice old people back.**

--
Some old recurred thoughts while going through my old written notes. Otherwise, not much thinking.

Spent a bit of the day and last night trying to left-over get food from restaurants. At first, it's a bit of a personal battle, perhaps a little shame in asking. Then, I remember, there's no shame at all, it's simply asking for a bowl of rice in the most inhospitable place in the world: the airport. People spend more on a cup of coffee. Restaurants probably throw their wasted food in the garbage, not even to compost. The results: robots. Robots with rules created by companies, just like their behavior. Such ugly animals.

In the most recent case, a coffee kiosk with quiche and breads, said that they *do* have wasted food, but the company doesn't allow to give to other people, afraid of [the company] being sued. I said don't worry, I won't sue your company even if it poisons me. Then she made another argument: she doesn't know what I would do with it, I could sell it. I said I'll eat it in front of her. Then she backed to company rules.

... [laptop battery dying :( ]

Why do humans behave in such an inhuman way? Fear? Fear that the company will be sued? Fear that she will be fired? It's such a simple thing to do, to give a piece of bread or a bowl of rice. Yet, they all (I must have asked 10 restaurants, from coffee kiosk to super-rich restaurants), spend so much effort making excuses, trying to ignore (on a Chinese cultural level) me, showing strain.

Again, just as hitchhiking in Japan, only good mothers are caring. In this case, one restaurant was able to give me a bowl of rice and some potatoes. The second day, a guy saw me asking for a bowl of white rice, a very humane guy, and said he'll just pay it for me. I nearly stopped him, insisting the restaurant should be able to give it, but I was quite hungry, and I didn't want to argue with a good guy, so I allowed him to pay for a bowl. Though, I really wanted his money for bread, which he diverted me by saying that they are closed (they weren't!).

The second day I went to that same first restaurant, but the nice auntie who gave me a bowl wasn't there. Instead, I waited at the entrance, and there was no service at all. Just waiters that look at you often. I thought then, perhaps it's culturally normal to just take a seat, because Hong Kongnese people are assholes after all. I think that was the reason as other people just go in and give a number. Still, at a culturally diverse airport, it's strange that they don't serve a person patiently waiting. I waited for a long time, winning the staring contests. I'm quite good now, after living in less popular areas of Taiwan now. Eventually, I just asked a guy. He feigned poor English and no Chinese. Played the I'm all up in yo territory game / sit-in. Eventually he gestured to go to the back. I waited there, until an one auntie called for another. This auntie knew English, I told her the story, and then she didn't really respond yes or no, as in, I can or cannot give a bowl of rice. So I waited for a bit, maybe they're half-discussing / half-working. By now the entire restaurant knows the deal. None human. All behave alienated, completely inhuman, smiling and talking to each other as they continue working. It was as if they only act according to capital, avoiding all natural human interactions. I waited for a bit, until another dude came out, who speaks national Chinese. I told him the story clearly, in Chinese. Again, the end response is not really yes or no, just amazement and looking down. I waited a bit. Then I started asking, well, are you able or not? No response from the older guy, or the older woman, only from the woman (auntie) at the desk who's been on her phone the entire time, pretending she didn't know either English or Chinese, and says they're not able.

That. That is the culture of China.

One gets this experience in Taiwan too, but, I feel, never at that level. I've fought idiots nearly my entire time in Taiwan: institutions (higher education, government) businesses (restaurants, shops), every capital-oriented place. It's bad, but they're human, or at least an animal with feelings. They're just stupid, un-thinking humans. But still an human. None will ever give a large amount of money, work, or housing, but maybe some food, $3 to 33, or the best advice they can give. And what's better, is that they themselves do stupid jobs, or eat as poorly as I do at my poorest times. Their standard of living is near a homeless person's. They seem to know or have had the experience of living in such a way.

At the airport, there's a clear difference, being under LLCs, knowing nothing of life. From completely stupid managers whose only way of dealing with people is repeating the same thing and / or ignoring, failing to argue completely, to slave workers who are unable to think, to perhaps the few humans, who are losing the ability to make decisions for themselves -- there was a nice younger girl at the front of the richest restaurant with the stupid manager; She said she hoped the wasted food wasn't thrown away. I don't think she got the point that I was hungry, but that was surprising to hear, as it was was something a thinking human might say.

Recently, I've been dealing with barely people at banks, post-offices, and immigration offices (though was more human than the airport). Just to get through all of the bureaucratic non-sense. They all behaved like slaves from different eras: 1960s at the post office, 1970s immigration office, 1980s banks. Such a strange time warp. Such a contrasting world to the digital-aged one.

Gladly, hopefully, I won't ever have to deal with any of it again. I must maintain myself with good friends. My hippie friends. My family. Nothing else. All of the inhuman people can die. I give up on them. I've tried for so many years, on varying political scales. But now I give in to pessimism. Realism? People are inhuman; That's a fact. I just have to accept it, ignore them, and live in my own social network. Forget the public. Go back to media. Live in nature. Avoid ever having to deal with any of them ever again, having only to make contact for shipped goods (postal workers) and groceries (farmers). No one else. Fuck the rest.

No thoughts for some time? Kind of true. I’ve been so deeply focused on the music idea and surviving, I’m unable to think about much else. Not about where to live, to meet, to organize, anything, really.

I slept early last night because I wasn’t able to score some leftover food last night. I woke up early to annoying flies and a gay dude who insists on helping me find my lost or stolen iPhone.

I tired my self by riding my motorcycle in the heat, dipping in the beach, then trying to get to the mountains to no avail.

All of this focus on this mobile place of sanity, I feel it may have been easier to simply just live in society. teaching English for an hour per week would be enough to get by. Why stress on organizing all that is required for this busking idea? It’s simply not worth the time. I’m not thinking in terms of time. But I should, shouldn’t I?

Shouldn’t I simply do what generates the most amount of wealth over time? Programming. Teaching. Oil rigging? Whatever?

No? Then it seems my ethics have gotten a hold of me. I am unwilling to do anything for capital. During (the time of) my first two jobs, I was okay with it. I thought, I can just **do the work**, then do whatever I wanted to do. Now, that state of mind is so difficult to get back. That Western, American work culture, of not thinking, and getting capital.

And now, now that I’ve finally focused my brain on capital, after many years of narrowly avoiding it, I’ve copied what hippies have been doing for thousands of years: performing and selling commodities. 

1. Performance in public places, constant creativity due to the public’s proximal attention, makes some of the best venues. Event-based venues are limited by time, which give the feeling of time-based work — having to get ready at a certain time to perform, just as one does for normal wage labor. Public places, places where the public transit through, such as parks and train stations, can be performed at whenever one feels, as there are always people there. Parks on Sundays, train stations on weekday mornings and afternoons, and event-places on Friday nights and Saturdays. That’s where the public goes.

Performances doesn’t have a limit. It can be music. Or it can be for games, such as playground games or table-top games, art, spoken-word style prose, public / free classes, conversation, anything. Just treat the public place as an event space: set an event, market it, and do it. Conversations on this day, class on that day, music whenever one desires. None of these ideas must be limited to a particular place: a school, an event venue, an art museum, a table-top game shop; Anything can be done in a public place, just as anything can be done in one’s own home or place. Public places are the ultimate place. All public places can become a Place of Arts. All public places have potential. Though, it is quite limited to the place: train station rules, park rules, etc.

To track the place-making events, one needs to communicate it, digitally for marketing, then with a sign for the proximal people. “Conversations about civics”, “DIY homes”, “film-making”. The public place becomes a sort of free-school.

Though, with weather issues, one’s own place can be better. But then, it isn’t nearly as public. Place of Arts and Babycastles were public places, but with all the social media marketing, only a narrow audience ever entered the places. In the public, there is more of a chance of attracting public on-lookers into the natural beauty of whatever the event is.

Taiwan’s day and night markets, and general public market culture come to great advantage here. Another public place, suited perfectly for not just selling, but doing anything really. It’s just a place where people stroll about. Though, perhaps, not the best for academic conversations. Better for entertainment-performances and commodity-selling.

Hmmm, perhaps it really all depends on the place’s organizer’s ability to attract all kinds of people? But for some reason, that’s really really difficult. It was even difficult to get people to simply play a game, how can one get people to engage in civic conversation? People are stupid. Too stupid.

But **event-making is** sharing. Sharing information, **sharing experiences**. **What else is there to do?**

**To live together, making experiences every-day.**

2. Taidong is a lame city, just as any developed place in the world. Lame choices in placing concrete in various areas. Complete destruction of environment, with cement roads, houses, artificial river and beach parks, cookie-cutter apartments, and so on.

Only in one’s own home, is one really free, to alter their external environment. It’s a great feeling. **Building a home is natural, but buildings are unnatural. Homes can be natural.**

The city, contrastingly, requires much politicking to alter it [the external environment]. With large companies for excavating material, transporting it, building things. There a lot of people involved in construction, land / property allocation.

Nature really is the only sane place to live. Good neighborhoods coming in second. Even farms require politicking to alter; Though, at least, it provides calmness due to the low density of people and buildings [todo: add link to these thoughts]. Perhaps farm areas, with their farm-houses, provide a semi-artificial / semi-natural suburb. Whereas suburbs are completely concrete, farm areas have farms and dirt roads, allowing one to bicycle calmly, whilst maintaining lively conversation with those around.

Thus, only natural areas are sane places to live: undisturbed mountains and beaches, as most flat-land has been purchased. Living next to a natural area is best, and farms on the other-side for calmness, and  a small town for the essentials. All of it must be within biking distance, as one doesn’t lose connection with reality, as it happens with fast transportation [link to this idea].

And the city? That’s optional. If one needs it or not. With the busking idea, performances, organized events where a narrow set of people are desired, it may be needed, for the convenience of everybody meeting up. But, perhaps, if the events are good enough, people will make the trip to a natural area, not too far from a small city (like the cities on the east side of Taiwan). Otherwise, everything would have to be done digitally: through digital communication.

Instead of living together, of having events together, people must live in nature, wherever their nature is, and participate in digital events to make up for the lack of social life in proximity. It’s not nearly as fun as proximal social life. It’s quite unnatural. But what can one do?

Saw a few framed large photos on the wall of the library in 台東. Great ariel photos of well-selected spots in 台灣: the farms of 宜蘭縣 and 台南, the northern-most island of 澎湖 which seems surrounded by snorkel-able sea, the north-easter plateau between 南澳 and 蘇澳, a crater-like-lake surrounded by high-altitude forest, sun-moon lake, and a few others. None seem to be very livable places. Mostly tourism. Of them, only the farms are livable, but even they seem entirely artificial, industrialized, with huge road systems developing the entirety of the coast. Still, those farms seem more livable than the sheer nature of the forest. Yet, there is a constraining feel to the farms, constraining freedom: One cannot simply go there and do whatever one wants. One is surrounded by property allocated to other people, who likely will simply reproduce industrial farms. It lacks possibilities. Thus, sheer nature actually seems a better place to live. Sheer nature, not far from civilization, perhaps, not far from those farms.

Don't feel like copying old notes, just feel like talking.

Saw an old note:
> 東山，宜蘭[縣] was indeed perfect.

What was perfect about it? It was peaceful. No cars or scooters. Or, not much. *Just* the right distance away from the town. Still, nearby, there are a few shops: a local super-market for packaged food-stuffs, a vegetarian 自助餐, tea shops, fried-food-stuffs shops, a second-hand store, all very cheap things. Some schools nearby for some space and sport areas. I guess, not too different in variety from the street next to 藝文樓. But where 藝文樓 had traffic and city, 羅東外 had rice fields, rivers to fish from and to plant things beside, mountains to motorcycle or bike or hike through, two waterfalls nearby; It even had a hot springs and cold springs and a beach not too far away, perhaps a few train stops away. The river near 藝文樓 was completely artificial, the mountain was 40 kilometers away, without a train, no springs, though probably a waterfall pool, but, most importantly, it was just all too far away.

It wasn't something one could bike to on the whim. Just from the doorstep of背包星球, one can bike through rural roads of endless rice fields, nearby shops on the same street, the town a mere 15 minutes away, a weekly night market, a daily night market, the river, the mountain, waterfall hikes.

From 藝文樓, one must first drive the scooter outside of the city, and, once outside, there aren't rice fields, rather, betel nut and coconut trees, and other farms, often industrial size, that completely block the vision, making it more difficult to grasp the beauty of the valley, as one can of 宜蘭縣 or Kathmandu Valley. **It's a feeling of ease that is provoked from such distant visibility.** When one can see the mountain, one has it in one's conscious, knowing one can always go, to nature, perhaps grab something to take home.

What was wrong? The architecture. The standard Taiwanese concrete farm-house. The bedrooms had air-conditioner, but the living room did not, and even with several fans, the best place to be was on the balcony. Similarly, at 藝文樓, the roof and the floor below it were the best, for the changing air, and, distant view. It was the only way to maintain homeostasis, the only way for one to be in the same place for a period of time lengthier than an hour, unless, one constantly drinks tea, coffee, or very sweet drinks. Both living rooms suffered from this feel.

Thus, the ideal place is indeed not too different from 背包客的星球. It indeed had it all, except the architecture. A place, next to necessities, not distant from a town with a daily day market, daily night market, and a train station; next to a cheaper version of a super-market, 自助餐, and a thrift store. Yet, close to the mountains, and, hopefully, with some natural rivers,...with hot springs!

What can be better? People say the weather in 宜蘭 is terrible due to the rain, but, I don't quite remember it being so bad. Or was it? Oh yeah, it was kinda bad. I remember just being in my room, on the computer, or, on the balcony, as it poured, wanting to watch a film, constantly drinking hot drinks. Perhaps it is, but I just don't quite remember it being *so* bad. I might have even liked it, being able to just read, think, happily.

There were so few times I went into town, or another town even. The place was near two similar towns, and I perhaps only passed through the second one, which is, the main town. I remember taking the train to the coast once, passing by the hot springs town on the way back. There was little to no consumption. Just a simple life. All of the creativity came from within. The night market was enough for selling commodities. It might have even been enough for performances! Who knows.

It was the right size. We knew the vendor-owners near us, the shop-owners too. That's all one can really handle anyway. **It's a similar experience to a city neighborhood, except, one can bike through endless farms, as opposed to running into traffic outside the confines of a city neighborhood, and, continue biking to the mountain or beach.** [|] **This biking pace, walking pace, this feel, is continuous.** In the city, one breaks the continuity by having to enter some alienating form of transportation, public or private, to get into another place where one is at comfort again: a friend's home, a cafe, a park. **In a good environment, the feeling of life is never broken. It is continuous.** Breaking it should be conscious, and, one should feel terrible whilst breaking it, on the subway or in a car, feeling existentialist.

At 藝文樓, the nearest escape was the river-side and two city parks. Although surrounded by farms, for some reason, perhaps the lack of rural-feel, or just the fact because the plants are taller, it did not invoke a good feel. Or, perhaps, because one had to first spend 15 minutes [on a motorcycle] of breaking through the terrible city roads to get to it all. Furthermore, the 45 minute trip to the nearest mountain was indeed a trip. By the time I got to the base, I would need another long break for thinking, having a drink, recovering from the cool air and pain of riding a motorcycle, likely already stopping a few times on the way.

Thus, one should live near a small main road, or, a good neighborhood (city, or even suburban [whatever that could be in Taiwan!]), that one feels good biking through. Then, extending that good bike feeling, there should be possibilities to town or nature; Nature being more important. I remember going to nature far more times than going to the town. The town was only needed for the occasional need of the public through the night market, and, getting to the train station, to pick someone up, or to go to a big city, for bureaucratic reasons.

Thus, a big city is unnecessary, save bureaucratic reasons, or an airport; Anyway, it is too far from nature; It requires breaking the flow to get to it.

**The town is almost unnecessary too. As there simply aren't many reasons to go to it, as the public is stupid**, which, was especially the case in 宜蘭縣 and even more so in 屏東市. There just weren't smart people to have conversations with. Thus, **the town served as a place to get raw foods from (farmer's market), to get raw materials from (material shops), to stroll through to see the stupid public once in a while (night markets), and, as **a public stage**, in case I desired to perform, sell, or do some sort of public act.

What about the farms then? They are quite unnecessary too. It just happens to be better than noisy traffic. Then why not nature? Well, perhaps there's some social, secure feeling in having some sort of humans around. Also, farmers are good people. They're not terrible. They're not completely detached from the environment. Perhaps a neighborhood would be good too. But that's usually full of cement. At least farms have some form of nature, even if it *is* completely artificial. A small neighborhood surrounded by farms, perhaps?

Why not nature? One still needs people, doesn't one? Does it count if one's relations with those people are nearly artificial -- only interacting through capitalism? The post office, farmers, farmer's market, and whatever else one needs in order to live?

**But I quite like those simple people. It's nice.** A fake-friendly, perhaps, but I do like having them nearby, and I do value them, as I've always venerated farmers and recyclers. It creates some sort of sense of reality. Perhaps, it was my fault for not talking to those people more. Surely they're all humans with great stories too, even if barely-conscious of it.

Or should one forget all people and be completely anarchic, like ancient foragers, self-sustainable? Ignore the world. It's possible. It's fun, even: to think about how to obtain food, how to obtain materials to make tools to make life a little bit more manageable, to think and design everything one needs and desires, and compare one's own natural designs to the industrialized world. But, quite difficult, or, perhaps, impossible, without computers, electricity..? What else does one really need, except the occasional hospital and thrift store visits? Hmmm... [todo: can continue].

**But it's selfish, isn't it? To just care about one's self? But when the world's desires have gone past so far simple life-styles, how can one care for it?** The farmers, the mom and pop restaurants, the postal service workers, the emergency care workers, the people that one relies on, sure. The rest? They *can* be ignored. That is why **a city is superfluous, and why a town is enough.** All of those shops in a city, those buildings, those places, those parks: superfluous. All that is needed are homes and those few essential things that towns provide.

# thoughts transcribed from sticky notes

[written in pencil and red ink]
## a sticky note
record environment
---
kids
train
traffic
$nature - insects, birds, etc,; beach, stream, waterfall, night market, day market
urban - 7/11, family mart, familiar sounds
people - talking

fun! simple music-making (in public)

vs

folk, talking, singing, rapping, etc. [lyrical]
  - performance art!

## a sticky note
self-record
---
[illustration]
iPhone or GoPro on a tripod, or, on a random object
  - [can also be used to record ambient sounds]
  - [todo: research / buy second-hand online (iPad and GoPro)]
Zoom h4n on the floor [optional, for live feel]

## a sticky note
busking -> cafe (ver 1.)
---
anywhere comfortable

[illustration:]
MIDI controller -> iPad (as DAW) -> (wireless/bluetooth) speaker
  - airplane mode (to save power)

todo: check power consumption

if wireless/bluetooth speaker, place it anywhere
must have good battery duration

compare bluetooth vs wired power consumption
  - [for the iPad]

thought:
add GPS to automobiles + backpack + iPad/iPhone


## two sticky notes combined
Akai mini set-up
---
me -> MIDI controller in front
      -> laptop on one side
        - only for synthesia / listening
        - also can be used as a DAW for times when the iPad isn't available, out of battery, or just not as usable as the desktop versions
      -> iPad on other side
       -> speaker
     -> mp3 player to listen to sounds / favs

how to begin playing piano?, without Synthesia?
  - need iPhone ;(
  - [print chords, practice, etc.]
  - able to print Synthesia-like notation?

play while charging?
[stopped here]

## a sticky note
I have such a strong desire to live alone now. In nature. Without the sloppiness of others. A simple life. Narrow, but good. Working like a slave at times. But, otherwise, free, to play, live, not constantly fight[ing] with society.

Relax, live naturally, think naturally, anarchically.

I don't like caring for idiots anymore. Only the 自助餐 matters. Not even farmers. All are slaves [because they are working out of habit, not for the sake of helping other humans survive]. Habituated to work. Kill the masters?

**Have money? No need to think / plan life.** Have no rent. Have nothing to care for. No people to mess my home. That's easiest. Then focus on huge ideas. Need [a] home first. A simple, efficient, home.

## a sticky note
Taiwan's education teaches people how to be racist, un-thinking, people. By trying to rationalize (create reasons for action -- 為甚麼，你知道嗎？ -- everything, they themselves have created a narrow imaginary social world of reasons people act.

For example, if a Taiwanese [cultured] person sees an Indian appearing person, they will automatically stereotype the person to their educated idea of an Indian -- social hierarchy, child marriage, hand-eating human -- and really believe it. That is the education that is taught: people of a color and/or of a nation do things for cultural reasons[: Or, racism.]

## a sticky note
找安靜的地方睡 ／ 停車
  - fail! Hah. Great ride. Farms. Beautiful, so close, mountains further than expected. Beach with jeeps at the shore!
  - if no rain, the beach!
    - but at times hard to predict

**need to rely on others for food**

great weather!
  - feel great!
  - exercise!

to todo:
**chill**
  - [stop acting toward capital, and just chill: live]

## a sticky note
**People who live with environment in mind, as home, as playground, are different (think different) from people who live in an artificial home. The rational doesn't think/care for anything outside of home. Ideas are generated [from within an artificial home], then applied to the world without experience with the environment.**
  - [Thus, resulting in a very unevenly developed, artificial environment.]

Old ideas:
(educated to stereotype) -> stereotype -> habit to stereotype -> racism
  - (Taiwan)
vs
treat people as complete strangers (without assumptions)
  - (SF/NY/hostels/travelers)

## a sticky note
My attention is so focused now, on music, art: I'm able to do what I desire.

I think less of the food I eat, the aunties that cook it, the farmers it comes from, how my scooter works, how electronics works. I'm able to do what I want, using these developments & technology. I let Taiwan's culture worry about that stuff. [The environmentally-conscious people.]

## a sticky note
Strangely, I will be using music to make money; All of those other good deeds never made money, being out side of capitalism's culture -- social organizing, event-making, sharing information (-- talking --), sharing experiences (-- living together--), urban material movement, all of my life for the past years, were voluntarily done...It just so happens that people have in their mind the idea to pay street performers, but not their mother's care.

**night jobs:**
Desire to play music, naturally, in the heat. No need to organize too much. Relax. [I'm/You're not changing the world with music.]

## a sticky note
Taiwan is a terrible country to be in as a non-citizen. But, perhaps so is anywhere else? Not really. Western countries will allow people who desire to work, work. Taiwan does not. Furthermore, they lie about work prospects -- shallow liars.
.
The hippies were right. So was I, at a younger age: to not believe in working with others.
.
Independent work -- sell commodity, perform. But what about freelance, social contracts? Nope. Never made a social contract [in Taiwan].
.
NY/SF/America are great. One can make social contracts. Easily. Quickly. No bullshit.
.

## a sticky note
[Taiwan's] Gov. too lame, though, way better than America.

I just the information, not all the bullshit; And information is obtained from reality. *Then* media. Not stupid events.
  - [my thought / response to the old town walk event]

[dont care about ink from here on]
