>“The foragers became farmers.”

It’s true that the process of becoming a farmer is of become habituated to tend to one’s own field, but, I feel, Harrari misses out on all of the psychological and environmental factors involved in that process.

Many people today still try to do this: live off the land. It’s interesting for a week, like any cool project, but then, one quickly realized how much work it takes. Unless you have a good plot of land with water, it sucks. Artificial gardening even worse. It takes up your life. Why do it now? It’s better to ask for food-waste. Why do it before? It’s better to go hunting or gathering. For today’s people, it’s the image of a self-sufficient farmer. For the early humans, it was probably, by happenstance, the right environment for farming and the wrong environment for hunting and gathering.

It’s a slow process. First, one must settle from the nomadic mind, a mind that can think of and walk through 15 kilometers per day. A mind always looking at the world. A mind constantly in contact with the world. A mind of infinite possibilities. Then, direct that mind to one of a few possibilities: to farm.

This isn’t normal for many personalities. Not mine. Perhaps more normative for those that judge and calculate, thinking of the future. I hope for warm weather and fruits.

**What’s hardest, I feel, is moving out from a permanent dwelling.** People nowadays get into contracts with property, so, they are quite stuck for financial reasons. But, it’s always surprising to see how few people are able to pack up and take the Chinatown bus to New York. When people settle, they settle in deep. Sometimes they’ll do anything to keep it too. Maybe it becomes something special, like, a home. Maybe they just miscalculate, not knowing they can live much more easily elsewhere. Maybe they have social relations that they don’t want to leave, like good friends in one’s own neighborhood, or city. Maybe those social relations is all that they’ve got. It’s either everyone stays or everyone leaves.

Likewise, even in a primitive situation, once one finds a nice spot, travelers tend to stay somewhere cozy, like a hostel in a rural area, or a place with free rent. One is living. One is more free. There are less worries. All of that is worth staying for too. Who wants to go back to daily nomadic struggles?

A good famous example is of McCandless, as he settles into a bus in Alaska. Sometimes I think people just overlook how hard it is to leave. There has to be a good season, sun-light, heat, the feeling to get out! Maybe it was simply colder in 9500bc or whatever. Maybe there was a bad winter. Life is more seasonal for the nomad. I’ve personally done this several times, settling during winter-times, or, just good environments: communes, hostels, comfy places I pitched my tent, **places where food and peace come easy.**

The body is definitely fit for walking and even at times running, crawling, and climbing. At a location-locked dwelling, the body doesn’t exercise all of its muscles, becoming quite unfit, even without the task of farming. Farming indeed can worsen it, as one waters, digs, etc. All of this makes it harder for the body to resume the more physically fit life of the nomad. It’s more of a zone-feeling. Like, at the beginning of a marathon or touring trip. There’s that initial phase for the body to break through and enter a zone of just crushing 20 kilometers per day with ease.

Really, it’s the habits of mind. Sometimes I get so into art works, thoughts, personal projects, local projects—that is, projects physically in the local environment—that I’ll stay in one place until something wakes me out of the slumber. Likewise, I think the primitive minds may have delved themselves deep, not just into farming, but a ton of other new projects: building a home, building protective devices against weather, animals, and people, building tools, and, making art.

In the next section, Harrari mentions an art project: a bunch of giant chiseled stones. Yes. Humans, even primitive ones, can prioritize art at the top of the things to do hierarchy (Maslow?). People survive to do their art! It’s more important. Or, maybe it’s just something everyone saw value in, to do together, as a community, like building a school. In this case, maybe they’re passing down knowledge to the next generations via stone carved pictures, like early heiroglyphs. Maybe it’s just an opportunity for people to express themselves to the world.

And like this, the details of why humans do whatever they did get lost. Harrari isn’t thinking of how the climate affects the body. How diseases affect. The day-to-day life. The mind. The thoughts. The feelings one gets on a hot summer’s day in nature. The mosquitos—Maybe the first settlement was a place without mosquitos! The insects. The natural life. Going with the flow. Just surviving and living, as opposed to the crazy calculations and rationalizations he appends to the actions of early humans.

The luxury trap isn’t about taking things for granted, it’s about having possessions, hoarding possessions, and become habituated to having them and creating rituals. Again, hard to leave once one has accumulated enough, especially in the case of a suitable home. Even contemporary nomads and travelers take quite some time shedding off possessions. It’s not that we count on it, it’s that we were simply habituated to use them. It could be for complete impractical, spiritual reasons. It’s the tradition of using possessions that is difficult to stop. The same way people traditionally drive cars every morning to get to their 9-5. It’s not that one takes the car for granted, it’s that people are simply unconscious of why they are driving a car and going to a 9-5 in the first place. (Unless, that is what he meant by “taking it for granted”...being unconscious.)

Anyway, I guess that’s enough of this book. My head already hurts.

Man, it’s effing annoying when writers, even Harrari, refute the stupidest common-place knowledge. In the chapter of animal domesticating, he keeps mentioning “evolutionary success” (reproductive success). Just tell the narrative, forget what people think! [todo: add to writings tips]

What really mattered that bit was that there’s 25 billion chickens. WTF. AND, 1 billion of each other domesticated animal: cattle, sheep, pigs. WTF. The food industry is so inefficient. Efficient in animal abuse, sure. Inefficient in getting food into peoples’ mouths. And that’s because of capitalism, and, people being spoiled and picky. Instead of eating whatever is available, people now have the choice. And that choice wastes a lot of unchosen choices.

One interesting thing from that chapter was that the way humans treated domesticated animals felt like a metaphor for a domesticated animal that was left out, other humans! All of that talk of finding efficient methods to milk cows, well, that sounds like business in capitalism. Long work contracts. No socializing. No fun. Just work. Cannot leave one’s pen (cubicle). Punishment for not working. Conditioned to work. Until people become meek sheep, losing all aggression. Perhaps there are places where employers castrate the male humans too.
