current ethical manifesto:
Only believe anyone that pays you. Everyone else is fake. Block and blacklist anyone that doesn’t respond to messages or e-mails, or rejects non-Taiwanese via phone call.

Do not answer anyone who asks where you are from, or any other stupid or prejudice questions. Tell them that you don’t enjoy gossip / fake talk / meaningless talk.

**Do not respond to anyone that doesn’t share with you.** And keep those that do close.

**Rid any friend that doesn’t help others.**
  - who’s left? Taifeng, Simone, Lamen.

Walk briskly past everyone. Get what you need and get out, back home.




today’s todo:
charge iPad
wash clothes (shorts, underwear)
brush teeth

  - apply to Medic mobile (session 1 and 2)

new strategy:
old strat: c/0. message all hostels in the taidong area (and Hualian area, because it’s easy to ask) for leads / work
  - hostel work may be best way to maintain sanity and do what I want
search temp work in tea shops in tainan city
  - 1. call all companies, the local people don’t know shit. Can try going to independent companies (choose what, grandpa tea). Can call from the beach (between swims) or library, where there isn’t much noise.
search temp work in Taidong
  -  1. email / message / call all (taidong gigs)
  - try other job banks?
  - try Facebook page?
emergency strat: search nearby temp work, labor work, farm work, event, temple, etc.

todo:
get back to reality, and out of information!
  - digital reality! facebook groups for [local] paid work, job boards
  - then, back to the reality that I create, through digital art / expression

digital
  - **iCloud backup and software update**
  - **check and delete photos**
  - **check and delete apps?**
  - delete bad books from (digital) library
  - **turn on voice dream backup**
  - **listen to music! and clean chrome tabs.**
  - get my data from goodreads somehow, or sync with voice dream?
  - delete my Facebook?
    - salvage data, zip it, save to dropbox
  - upload photos of my (analog) writings
money?
    - can also beg at train stations / places i sleep
    - must search for free places to eat (get name of buddhist organization)
pay andy?
  - shit
message Andy, and (email) Billy
  - ask Chris for Billy’s email
inform Billy of passing by
  - pick up stuff? Still want to leave my hard drive some-place safe. Also, my winter clothes aren’t necessary.
  - check for notebook
**search digital notes for “green notebook” and “notebook”**
  - check iCloud
  - i feel like i lost it at Taibei’s airport, or, Hong Kong’s.

now:
**withdraw money:
no way? try tech guy**
  - **also that guy from Hualian facebook page**

soon:
1. find work
  - use various job banks (1111, yes123) to find jobs in Taidong area, especially tea shops, list numbers, call.
    - can try jobs other than tea, such as labor, farming, short-term, etc.
3. find temp work in Tainan
4. buy iPhone (and internet plan?)
5. find a home [or place to pitch tent?] near nature (can begin creating a community)
  - far from the city / development. Don’t care if it’s difficult to take busking equipment there! Will get a car later.
  - still, need electricity. Charging devices in public places suck. Unless, it’s some kind of public rest stop? Or, a solar panel! Or, a car!! Ugh, yeah, I just need a car.
6. busk & temp work
  - really, really, really want to busk! (need to reset iPad to use Garageband)
7. get a laptop (late 2013’ish, can try a public library’s computer in the meantime, or, buy a really cheap PC)
8. computer work (& busk & temp work)
9. get a car
10. create the dream community
11. keep dreaming

11-6
Sunday. Eating breakfast at home makes all the difference in having equanimity. Life begins at home, in constant equanimity, then goes out.

5-6
Hot day. Have money to buy tea and ride motorcycle. Feel great. Laundry and shower day.

Need to call people from library at night. After I have internet, life will be easy, because I can then call people from home. **That’s perhaps the greatest power: the ability to contact people from the convenience of home, to arrange for work.** Then, it’s just Chinese practice, constant calling, asking for work [the same for arranging meeting people: can contact people, arrange meet-ups, etc.]. No need to go to libraries, struggle for homeostasis, etc. Time is tracked. No commute. No unconsciousness. That’s real life.

Tainan is indeed one of the word places for a non-citizen to be. Steeped in tradition and lethargy, there is no hope for any sort of progress. That is precisely why nothing has changed for so long: laziness. A world of feeling females would just unconsciously follow traditions, not thinking of anything outside that small bubble. I must get out.

The markets of Tainan are not close to the streets. All capital-generating is frozen in ancient properties. It is not dense, coming together, spontaneously nor in an organized manner. It’s possible to vend, but nowhere close to the way Taibei works.

**The big cities are more altruistic precisely because it accepts cooperation from anyone to get money.** Other places are un-cooperative, unwilling to change, stuck in habit, often tied to property or even relations. Sticking to social and material relations without conscious why.

Perhaps the goal for some Taiwanese is simply to do what feels good. It feels good to have shallow social relations, simple labor work, not too much thought. It feels good to have a partner that thinks of that stuff, and to simply tag along. Weaving toward what feels good and away from anything that requires thinking. This is how capitalism develops in some of the hotter, less work-ethic minded cultures. And, in doing so, people barely get by, creating a terrible urban environment and an equally terrible social environment in the process, as there is no thought of what influence capital has, or any rebellious attitude against it. Capitalism pervades easily in the obedient culture. The rich individuals and institutions dictate nearly everything visible in the public. It’s ugly.

These days I’ve been spending time in public libraries, watching kids toil over math, procrastinate, resulting in absolutely nothing. No thought. The educational institutions win. Kids lethargically practice synchronized dance routines, rote memory prevails in all forms of insitituonal education: learning of language, learning of canons, learning of popular history. Nothing is ever learned, except, to follow rules, follow obediently, of whatever authority: teachers, government, business bosses, etc. I need to get out of the cities of Taiwan, and back into nature, or, anarchic spaces.

Anyway, after seeing some people talk in the public, I realized, all I really need is, in addition to work, is some social life, even if it’s shallow. Just do the work, get a girl, be stable, then can move on to better stable situations.

4-6
Malleable urban patterns, like markets. Without property. Maybe can apply to nature for a malleable place to live? While busking, can advertise professional skills too: web-site design, etc.

3-6
Yet again, I run into the problem of Taiwanese people wanting to hire people for long-terms. The bourgeoisie want slaves. They don’t understand it alienates people, and that people want to spend time doing their own things, with their own friends.

Further, the kitchens that feed those in need don’t offer social services. They just feed, barely keeping people alive, not knowing what each individual really needs. It’s torture.

—
Talking to the girl at the church reminded me that all one really needs is a talkative, lively human. The humans in Tainan are dead. No life in them. Just like the Factory.

It reminds me of why I left the suburbs for the city: for talkative people! Active people. Not just lazing around, cooking, cleaning, barely surviving. Rather, hyper-active, constantly thinking and doing and talking humans.

It’s the talking part that constitutes life. One can think in a closed room. One can do without talking, but, it is lifeless without communication, interaction.

I need the city. If not, people. Lots of people!!

Use the computer to make up for the lack of people, lack of humans.

Talk talk talk. Act act act.

Yet again, I can’t wait.

I must escape the heat, drink cola, and do the work, and remember to talk as much as a i can in between.

2-6
Having Rick Roderick’s lecture on my music player was a great idea, as I just listened to it again, and, it seems to get better and better. This time I listened to the last four lectures, grasping it all in two settings.

Hegel shifts the lecture’s attention from entirely theory propositions (virtue ethics) to **observing society at different periods of time**. Marx’s economic manuscript is invoked for many many theories that I don’t quite remember (todo: but worth re-listening for!). Weber too, along with Kafka, to describe the bureaucracy of the state.

Nietzche’s *genealogy* sounded like Fouccoult’s *archeology*, except he does it with morals: seeing **how morals—good, bad, truth, etc. values?—change over time**. Virtue in ancient Greece to Christianity to now. How that changes from doing what you want to love and resentment (that you can’t do what you want, because you feel guilty). Rick also talks about how slaves are constrained to do what they want, and, by just showing love, will be repented in the next life; **That sounded precisely like all the sacrifice laborers and women undergo—living for love, instead of economy or power.** Knowledge is power, or, **knowledge is associated to structures of power** (and even structured by power?). **People need *human requirements*—food, shelter, basic health-care—before they can live.** **Social arrangements obviously wrong because of the disparity between technology and homeless people (in DC). If terrible jobs like McDonalds and service jobs are what “non-educated” people can get, “that already puts a few under the bridge”.**

Kierkegaard’s sickness unto death was used to describe the robots that the system creates. In apocalypse films, you actually are living, as opposed to the boring real life in modernity. In Blade Runner, you can’t even die, you don’t have the imagination to kill yourself. Your memories are commodities: TV, films, etc. There are no real human moments anymore. Everything is an image, like Reagan. “Larger than life”. **Spectacle.** Despair is the sickness. Death is the way out, but impossible. Unconcious despair (completely economically determined lives), conscious despair (that you still have to be in the system), and one more that I can’t recall. Things happen on the TV: news of a country bombed, next minute one is watching a familiar sit-com. See LA, or a mall.

Freud’s discontent for civilization is invoked for examining the unconsciousness. Uses a metaphor of a splendid city with a garrison as what is conscious and what isn’t. The garrison being the last bit of consciousness. Real memories dumped outside the city. Mass culture’s goal is enlightenment in reverse (Frankfurt School): to get rid of that last bit of consciousness (enlightenment as the process of increasing consciousness, like Proust). Rick suggests reading what some dude says to the Corinthians in the new testament about hope. **Once that hope is lost, the hope of radical democracy, etc., all is lost.** It used to be that people had to go to place to get culture; That there was nature; Now where’s nature? [todo: missing quite a few more ideas]


6-1
Hmmmmm. Ate too much and stayed asleep all evening yesterday. Too much food? Too hot in the shack? No life to react to? Mind habituated toward money? Nothing to do except get money.

And, there’s no way to get it, it seems.

Thought of a great idea: save and invest enough money to get $300-500 per month.

5-26
Watched some melee competition the last two nights. Surely totally alienated, but nice to have. Good laughs at their mafia game and the commentators. Long daydream of extending the mafia scenario to a hilarious skit.

Too many tourists on the beach, but the sky is now beautiful, along with the air.

Today was also the first day I didn’t ride the motorcycle into the city. And in doing so, feel normal, sane. It’s the city that drives me insane, creating a desire within me to alter it all: the people’s behavior and environment. It’s the opposite of a rural home.

And I still very much desire that rural home. To come home. Have food. Do whatever I want. Freedom.

In order to attain that dream, I just have to stay calm, as I was today, patient, calling people for work. Not desiring to alter the minds of stupid, racist, capitalist people. Then, just do the work and come back home, to the beach. No libraries, convenient stores, parks, or any place with people staring at me. Do the work and just go home. A quiet life.

I dreamt of the rural home again, with a fridge with bread, and lots of bananas around. No need to get food from the restaurant. Just eat bread, fruit, steamed veggies, as I did in America. A totoro home. I can’t stop dreaming about it.

For the longest time, I didn’t want to work toward it. I just wanted to go, talk to people around, do things together. But it seems no one wants to do things together. Instead people just accumulate capital and go home. And now, after 10 years, I too will follow, at least, for a moment. Hopefully I can create a culture, community, to work with people together.

Checked out an English teaching place. Ugh. Business-minded robots. Employers that only judge by past experience, as opposed to current passions and the individual as a whole.

I’m still dreaming of the east. **Whatever temporary job, I don’t care, as long as it’s there. The east is my home. I’ll be happy as long as I’m there.** It maybe similar to a childish desire, yet, it’s knowing what one wants that is part of knowing who one is.

Although I hate riding my motorcycle to any sort of city, I think, or, I hope, I can do it from a natural home to Taidong [city], for temporary work. Then, get better at finding other temporary work, and, busking, and, other ways to survive [(night market! teas via tea box! locally forages teas (!!!), locally foraged foodstuffs, computer and media and tech and digital life)]

Just one fucking job. One tea shop. That’s all I need. How is it so fucking difficult? Is this really what excluded people suffer in totally hegemonic countries?

Welp, I guess I’ll try calling tea shops, etc. gigs, see if I find a soul through the telephone or email. Can even try asking hostels in the area for tips, systems to find temporary work, and even if they themselves have anything.

Yessss, the buddhist restaurant and motorcycle have given me the energy needed to work! Can’t wait! [perhsps my last adrenaline of optimism I’ve got]

5-20?
The surfers treated me for dinner last night. Today was a kind of social hangover day. There was a moment where I was sitting and didn’t want to do anything.

Is that complete alienation? My body was in perfect shape with a shower, junk food, and cloudy weather. Is this how I really was when I was young? No reactionary life-style? Only media to move me? No reality in mind, no worries of reality in mind? Surely, that’s complete alienation.

I am not moved by the nearby nature as I used to be. I am not moved by the articulate alterations of the environment nearby as I used to be. I am not of desire to talk to people, get to know their mind, get to do things together, create, philiosophize, change the world. I am un-moved.

Once I get some cash, will it provide me the freedom that I need to be alive again?

An earlier thought: I need a carry-on bag, or, a duffel bag with a separate wheel-barrow, then, a car. Never again do I want to be limited by the need to nicely arrange my belongings, nor of space.

Amazing weather everyday, wasted, toward orienting myself for capital. Ugh. Hopefully can get money from Taifeng, then use it to buy iced tea, maintain homeostasis, and be more productive, in my organizing.

Such a fantastic time letting go for a moment for a few hours at a festival that I nearly did not go to! It’s a good thing Holly is still a child-at-heart! More lovely than, perhaps, anyone else I’ve met in Taiwan, that is, any Taiwanese person I’ve met. Taiwanese are just cold. Freezing. Zero love, play, fun.

Now, I feel better than ever, as an alienated, ambivalent person. I think I’m finally able to become a soulless machine again, a slave for the dollar, an efficient machine within a larger machine.

Off to work, I slowly go, toward. Is this it? Am I giving up my infinite creativity, freedom, now? I’ve never compromised before...to the point I’ve begged at the subway station. Well, I’ll see. I still want to busk...

Perhaps, when I see people, people’s faces again, it won’t feel like alienated work, but one with some Taiwanese family. Perhaps...

Contorting my life to the zero creativity of the market is so grating. The market can’t pay creativity: there are no people with taste.

Well, I could get to Kickstarter... But, I think, that would require me have actually started the project, had a few examples, and then...

Ugh. Has it come to this?

Taiwanese people are terrible. Fake. So fake. I need to ignore it all, get out. Perhaps, then, the east side is indeed, in addition to being a better natural environment, is a better cultural environment. At least, people are real. Instead of treating you like an animal at a zoo, they don’t even interact with you. That way, there is no false sense of hope that people actually care, really care, about others. Join the pessimism, the suburbs. Get the money from the market and go home. The world is too stupid to have an anarchy. The people are too stupid. Useless, unproductive in every way, playing pokémon whatever while riding an old scooter, attending to ancient cultural habits. They waste their leisure time, their life, with much costs. Those who don’t work toward anarchy during their lesiourous life should die or be severely limited in actions, as to not waste (resources and time of others), distract, like gossiping sheep.

Time for a more productive life. Redistributing food to the homeless, and so on. In the circle of life.

Sunday! Finally, the only day where there is no traffic on the streets of Taiwanese cities, and when one can clearly feel the path toward nature, riding toward it, without having the non-sense traffic on the way. Yes. I can never live in a city again. No more traffic.

I must do all of my city chores today! Seeing the auntie. Paying Taifeng (and borrowing x ntd). Fetching (and repairing) the bike. Whatever else! Heck, maybe I can even leave tomorrow!

All that is left is to look for work? I’ll have to do it myself, as no one in Taiwan likes to cooperate.

I guess I could find an even more far-out place in Tainan for a few days, while getting food from the bhuddist place. Or, I could be more active, searching for such places along the way.

Search for work and places to eat along the way! While traveling. Yeah, keep on moving through small towns, stopping by public bathrooms, or those nice truck-stop comfy convenient stores. But, mostly, stay outside! Summer-time!!

Even if you are poor, the summer is free.

At this point, I just want to work, get money, build a little home, a private space, do whatever I want. Real life, anarchic life, public life, political life, public art, will all have to wait.

So, begin by calling places? Or, ride the motorcycle until I see some sort of work? Both. But, I should try searching for work online by area (southeast Taiwan).

The books are beginning to bore me, though, after wasting much time looking for my interests, I did find some sane writings, particularly Graeber’s essays and James C. Scott’s essays, as they write a little on how they’ve come to amatchg in the intros to each collection. Still, a bore! I’d rather be doing the actions!: art projects, political projects, material sharing, urban alteration, etc. The writings, in comparison, are just for passing-time.

Could never live in a Taiwanese apartment. Only outside, away from people. That’s what I feel from Taifeng’s apartment. Way too uncomfortable, ‘packed like sardines’. It also has backwards, village mentality neighbors, always staring.
