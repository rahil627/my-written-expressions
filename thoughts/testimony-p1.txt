## events only (without my thoughts)
### main points of the talk (without dialogue)
* I try to talk with him, for a few minutes. He replies with a few repeated words (perhaps 10?).
* He stops talking completely.€。
* I continue talking a little more, but eventually give up because he is not responding, and try to get away from the situation.
* He explodes, snatching the motorcycle key.
* I notice the he’s upset. I try to talk again, more submitting this time, for about 10 seconds.
* He explodes again, trying to wrestle with me.

€ Note: When he stopped talking, he doesnt talk all night: including during the fight, after the fight, and even at the police station; He is unable to talk because he is clearly still upset.

(See the police interview for a more detailed dialogue. [But remember: It is clear that he is completely unable to have a conversation during that time. So, the actual dialog doesn’t matter much. Only his short-temper matters.])

### fight
#### standing (few seconds)
* I put my right hand out to receive the motorcycle keys, near his right hand.  
* Something happens quickly. I’m not sure. [I think he tries to restrain me, but doesn’t know how, so we play wrestle for a few seconds?]
* Suddenly, I am in a headlock!
* ...
* I think and then decide to respond by reaching my right hand for his neck, with little to no pressure, like holding a cup (as defense).
* He responds immediately (without thinking or conscious decision) by lifting and slamming my head first into the ground, while still in headlock. (The right side of my body hits the ground.)

#### ground (long time!)
* ...
* On the ground, I can now see the Family Mart employee and another person using his phone. I tell them, in Chinese,「因為我沒有車牌，警察可以打我嗎！？你告訴他我住在這裡一年！他瘋了！很笨蛋！」.
* ...
* ...
* My arms [both!] are still free, so, I use my right hand to reach for his neck, again. This time, I cannot entirely reach, so I can only touch using 3 fingers, and try keep my hand there (as defense).
* I tell him 「別用力。。。因為我沒吃飯兩天我沒有力。我應該可以打死你。。好運。。」
* ...
* ...
* I take my my right hand back.
* ...
* He uses his left hand to use the radio to call to his friends.
* I flail my left hand behind his back, somehow swiping his radio!
* ...
* ...
* I tickle his left hip a few times.
* ...
* ...
* The real police comes.


## events including my thoughts
### my general thoughts during the talk
I generally felt that this is a rural-minded Tainanese person; Perhaps just finished a duty of directing traffic at a broken traffic light or a construction site nearby.

I generally don’t feel like talking to these kinds of people because they’re just not able to talk or think too much. Normally, they just ask you, 「你從哪裡來的！？，妮妮？妮妮！？妮妮！？！你在這裡幹嘛？工作？工作！？工作！？！。。。」. There’s no way to answer the questions because they often think what they want to think, no matter what one says to them. Talking doesn’t help. In fact, talking can make them more angry (as it happened here!). In these situations, I really don’t know what to do, so I just try to agree, ignore, avoid, and walk away.

For this person, *I sensed the same exact feeling* from him. That its just one of those people that I want to avoid. But this time, it’s either a traffic controller or a lower-ranking cop! And instead he’s repeating 「你的車子沒有車牌。你不能起！；你的證件！；你沒有證件呢！？你是從哪裡人？你是從哪裡人！？從哪裡！？！。。。」. And again, there’s no way to answer his questions because he is unable to listen, talk, and perhaps even think. So, for the same reason, I felt compelled to try to ignore, avoid, and ride away.

I drove very slowly to see how he reacts. I wanted to see if he’s even conscious at all, if he himself thinks he’s a cop or not, or if he’s just mindlessly bothering me with stupid questions like anyone else on the streets of Tainan city.

He responds like an upset child, taking the key out of my motorcycle. At this point, I understand he’s angry now, his temper obviously short€. So, I submit and just say 「OK，沒關係，我沒去哪裡。我們可以等警察來。只是回給我我的鑰匙」to try to calm the person down, and appear more peaceful. I just really wanted my belongings, including the key, so that I can sit alone with my belongings and wait until a real cop, hopefully one who is able to at least speak Chinese (國語) with me and perhaps know 台語 to communicate with him, comes.

€ Note: Conincidentally, I had recently encountered similarly short-tempered, extremely conservative-minded Tainan people. (Only in Tainan, not the rest of the country.)

Although I do not understand the minds of this sort of people, I at least understand when they become upset, like a young child: they don’t talk for a period of time...then suddenly explode.

That’s exactly what happened, twice.
