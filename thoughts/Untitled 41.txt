Can I ever escape this trap?

The timing-based kitchen causes my body to eat extremely un-evenly: once per day, along with a long bicycle commute.

Can I even get any work done this way? How will I charge my laptop? Go to the library to charge every-day? That’s no good... I’d have to try to do most of the work on mobile devices at home, using usb batteries.

    - the projects never stop! :)

Though I have not been able to find people to do projects with, perhaps, if I can find a happy balance of doing them my-self while living *beside* people...

...but isn’t my desire to *change* people for the better?... My projects are about changing people, not merely doing things independently beside others. *I want to work dependently, together.*

I want to live *and* work together. Work is a part of life.

*I want to work with people toward making a better society, together.* **It’s through living together we figure out how to make it better.**

We work individually, yet we generally work together. How much is individual and how much isn’t doesn’t matter; It depends on the personality, culture, state of mind, ‘n-so-on anyway.
