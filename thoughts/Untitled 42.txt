A good day of recycling. It felt good: good to: drink and eat left-over junk: coffees, teas; get fed; keep what’s useful, up-cycle. The natural life: a day of cleaning.

Is there a site to find people throwing out their belongings? It could be fun making a home out of that junk, all-the-while living well, simply. and maybe even making a tiny bit of money.

I would really need a car to do that though. Other-wise, I’d be restricted to what I could fit on the back of my motorcycle.

.

Ah, an earlier thought: This physical life-style is so pleasant. It’s life. I love it.

In contrast, I don’t feel like doing some sort of writing. It’s not life. I dread it.

What to do? Half-half?

I also dreamt: of organizing a group of hippies to leave from the shack to go work at a water-melon farm together, emphasizing people who need the money. Us simple hippies need to unite, work together to work together.

A closed, invite-only Facebook page perhaps. And an e-mail list. Of job postings of good, simple, non-discriminatory, temporary jobs. Hopefully, in the future, the hippies themselves will have their own businesses, and later post for hiring.

This sort of *good*, inclusive network might be what’s necessary to enable good people to live. Just some simple work to do now and then. That’s all. Then, back to their little shacks and abodes to continue living simply.

That’s all a person with a simple life-style wants: simplicity. Ease to get money especially, without the chains hidden within contracts. Why is that so difficult?

The answer to that would require writing **a history of institutionalization**, which, in addition to being difficult for my personality, is not of my concern.

What we want is the ease to live easily...Now!

And what I must do is create the technology and/or organization to make that happen.

Not WorkAway, but **WorkTogether. A network for temporary workers, including trust features.**

Facebook groups do not have trust built in-to them. Neither does Craigslist. Some sort of way to display trust is almost necessary. Also ways to show discrimination, narrow-mindedness, authority-abuse too. This way, more equal relationships are nourished, and, the bad ones punished, called out.
