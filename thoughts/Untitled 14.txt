Drank with ALiang. Buzzed. Perhaps drank alcohol 5 times this year. It’s not bad. It’s sociable.

But...the people are terrible: Jehovah’s witnesses. Ugh. Except Joel, who’s lived hear for 15 years. His family is great.

It’s good to live though....just hang out. Talk. Chill. I think...

Still...I wished it were with the communes: The Factory, Place of Arts, Babycastles. With them, I can really hang, really be happy, doing the things we love, striving to be good, do good, make cool things, be cool. Other people are just, ugh. I really need my friends, my hippie friends, exploring new ways to live, plants, technology, dreams.

**Chasing dreams with friends,** that’s what I want to do. Just chase dreams. Reach toward shared ideals. **Adventuring with friends.** Exploring the world and mind together, forever.

And...how can I do that? **I have to build a group of idealistic friends. Keep them. Forever.** That’s the ideal life. Adventuring with friends forever. Doing good. Talking. Constantly socializing and validating each others’ personalities.

I have to build that sort of group of friends. Old and young. Adventuring, forever.

That would be so great...having a group of friends in a neutral part of Taiwan, exploring our minds and the nature around us....ahhhhhhh, soooo clooose. All I have to do is get my finances straight! Then, move east, find a home, use the internet to find cool people, bring them together, live together, work together, explore together,do things together...

Should I aim for a girl-friend first, or just a group of friends? I Should aim for anyone, and, if someone matches with me, well, that’s fine, and, if not, that’s fine too. Go naturally.

So, I just have to ace this money shit firs.t Get money. Do it. Go east. Get more money. Do it. Then build the dream community.

Yeahhhh, I think I just have to get drunk and fuck. Stop thinking so much! Just do some stupid work, drink, talk to girls on some dating site, meet, fuck, and move on with life.

And the way to do that is to contact people for work. Once I’m done with work, I can move on to dating in the local area, then, slowly make my way over to Taidong. While dating, I can try to work together, or find ways to get money together.

...

Yeahhh, I think the only way for me to work is to be drunk. This is fun. Just b drunk, sociable, and work. The people here are too fucking boring anyway, might as well make fun myself, be extra sociable, and do whatever work.
