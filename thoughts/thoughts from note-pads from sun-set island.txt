# ideas
## from a to-do sheet, blue ink
$$$$ crowd-fund to clean environment
  - reall good because it’s a mutual interest, quite different from personal arts (essays, essay films, etc.)

use Taiwan crowd-funding (-> should find people that volunteer actions to aid) to fund local projects:
mapping food waste,
mapping trash,
environment
  - clean / daily routine
  - vote on color
  - crowd-created map overlay

## from a sheet
full internet mode / fuck people
avoid church; waste of time, money, distracting too.

## from another sheet
unconscious of everything:
scooter commute
time

## another sheet
need good (-> ideal) institutions, to work with, to build dreams with.
need good mothers, to do survival work with... Just survival, nothing more. No extra needs.

## another sheet
react to reality -> action
vs
react to media -> day-dream

## another sheet
[illegible: ~Wat[on] Lote - Sma[ng] + them on [kack]]
day-dream of just spreading truth by traveling and performing
want to perform after seeing Chapelle / T.I. Collab. I can sing about the truth...on the streets? And record myself.

## another sheet
**only those that work with me can be considered community. It means they share**, un-like the institutional and traditional.


## another sheet [black ink]
1. Man, I *hate* the police, *hate* traditional people — Tainan especially!

Money is not the solution to the problem of tradition, yet, somehow, cities are infinitely better places (as in, having infinitely better people).

It’s just a better environment **with more people experience**, more activity / **active people, therefore, more conscious**. **Rural areas and traditional areas are mostly unconscious, habituated people that never change.**

## another sheet [black ink]
Video game culture is just a way to hang out, joke (shit-talk, have fun, which is seperate from the moral path with active goals. Still, sometimes, it’s nice to let loose, be unconscious, hang out, chill.

Still, I would rather do those things in the way of Place of Arts, Babycastles, etc. A practical way of hanging out: working together, eating, talking, sleeping. Rarely is there a need to play (video games), merely consume entertainment. Also, Taiwanese people are terrible to hang out with, not playful at all (unable to joke, have fun, have good humor, be quick and witty).

## another sheet [black ink]
Too hot!—Need air conditioning for these days. Or, a bunch of fans, and caffeine? + Ice.

Pervert old dude or just “caring”?
—

Still depressed, neither exploring the world nor interacting with people. **Need** air-conditioner and **people that are capable of holding a conversation, joke, play;** artists, gamers, kids.

## another sheet [blue ink, maybe even older than black ink]
[maybe copied elsewhere]
$$$ Attention, culture, and community.
culture affects attention, which then creates communities.

a person enters a culture whose attention is on fighting game culture or hippie ethics, and those cultures keep the people together because of a common interest (which is in the attention of the culture), creating communities.

## another sheet
the weather mid-August is finally comfortable enough to live normally; the rest of the time was a struggle against heat, mosquitos, bad health, bad urban planning, bad culture (especially the extreme discrimination for employment).

## another sheet [red ink, I think the newest]
In this way, Asians win, with their slave-like work ethics to build small businesses. It’s narrow, straight-forward, something that only a few cultures can do [tolerate] —like Gujarati and Punjabis. The rest of us live life less narrowly, doing a wide-array of things every-day.

Is it better to organize a small business for one’s self? Or, is it better to organize a community / commune? Or, is it best to simply live in a city where projects are being created, socially, every-day?

The first is least social. The second is social, but limited to the minds within the community / commune. **The third [city] is best—work with anyone, not just the city, but with the country, the world.** Projects are temporal. Family businesses is for more structured, even often set for life.

## another sheet [red ink]
By constantly working with each other, with the right people, that a stable life is built. Yes, it requires seeking the right people. Most of those people themselves will be part of institutions, but, at least one can be social, doing what you want, together keeping things changing.

The more projects the people the better.

Work *with* small businesses, institutions—carefully!—, anarchy / hippie orgs, and whatever structured groups of people, just be careful, maintain principles / integrity.

## another sheet [red ink]
To do that—to constantly create / join projects one needs a flexible group of people constantly also creating and joining / participating in projects. Most likely, a city.

Temporary gigs, meet-ups, interactions, all create more and more ideas and projects. Places that lack these ideas (temp. work, inclusive meet-ups, social interactions) will not have such an environment, instead, favoring stale, clique / village mentality, long-term jobs, no social interaction.

Thus, for passion’s sake, it is better to not have a stale, long-term business / sole institution, and, instead, invest in artist friends, event-making, art-making, and do temporary work (-> at other institutions) to get by.
->
survival institutional work: Wal-mart, truck delivery, water / tea / food, home repair, transport repair
/
constant thinking, talking, interacting, doing, playing, creating: the passionate life
->
KickStart all of it.

## another sheet [red ink]
Much more recent date:
The institution trap: it is easier / requires less thinking to simply join an institution to work, get money, then do whatever you want to then to organize one’s own way to get money, do the work, often alone for the initial phase—creating institutions is a lonely process. Joining institutions is a social, simple process, one talks it out with others, until one finds the right institutions / group of people.

Asians, immigrants, people in developing countries may be used to doing the work, creating an institution with the family: a family business. People in developed cultures may find that difficult or strange compared to merely joining existing institutions, or, wading one’s own way through groups of people until a social way of creating an institution or project appears.

## another sheet [red ink]
$$$ selling at (out-door street) market feels way better than selling at one’s home. Should keep these seperated.
->
home - market (capital)
->
simple! (food, drink, craft)
