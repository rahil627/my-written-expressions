# thoughts from papers from NTU

## a page
Woke up 4pm? 5pm? Oh well! No matter. As long as your brain is working. But is it? Not really. Neither action nor communication.

Without a space, without people, I slowly become habituated to do nothing as I did in the suburbs as a child. I need people. I need organizations. I need people going on their own directions, to allow me to be a little social. I will always create my own directions, but a base, a base organization / set of organizations seems needed. To be competitive, independent, to work [from nature?] is not right, is it? Or do I just need to bring a little of that social world to nature? Xiao and some aboriginal kids. Is that enough? The city and their organizations offer so much more.

People are dying -- Doctors on Borders -- yet here I am, lazily living. This can't be right. **I must be a part of that social development, to be outside of it is to be lifeless. I can't live like a hermit.** I can't go home. I can't create a home in a cozy farm east of Tainan (as so many Ghibli films romanticize). I must be a part of society. I am too human. Those that live outside are not.

A person may want to talk about one interest but not any others. And so one needs many people. More diverse. Less specific. More artist friends. **The best place in the world is the place with the most amount of artists, because they can talk about anything.** I miss that -- being able to talk about anything. It was a fast mess, but it felt great. Hostels and NY.

But later I'd surely narrow my interests, to games, urban planning, human geography, and so on. And, in exploring knowledge, I'd lose my friends. I desire to communicate about what I'm interested at that moment in time, which is impossible. **I should have communicated those interests to my friends, as opposed to continually seeking people with similar interests.**

The dry, warm, closed basement *floor of McDonalds is so homely. I need it.**

**Perhaps I should go to Tainan first, then travel around?** No. Travel to free mind, not just rural work.

## another paper
Even as a child I had social problems. I'd want to go exploring on bikes, so I'd get Matt, Jacob, Mike to come with me. Perhaps they got tired of it. I never did. And I kept exploring. they probably developed social relationships. Later, I kept fighting society, others probably stopped, contiuing a culturally normal life. But what is life? I kept questioning how to live, what to do, at every moment, only the frequency changing, when [fat?], I questioned every action, when not, I would at least question what to do daily, figuring something out at night to execute the next day. I did something every day. It was my choice. Then, later, I flowed more with the world, less with [ad?] plans, more life in mind. It wasn't about what data told me to do. It about talking? I just kept talking -- to people, through media, to lcoal people, to books, to Wikipedia, talking my way through everything. All material of my American past was gone. It was about communication. As for material, tea was enough, 50lan, red tea near Emily's, or milk tea at NTU. Teh rest of life was of communication, becoming more and more book-oriented, but still communicating; whether it was through film, reality books, audio-books. **I maximized communication.** At times I communicated so much that I didn't clean my body; I'd sacrifice hygiene. I'd sacrifice exercise too. But I talked. And I loved it. Whether it was in Chinese, with dead philosophers, local people, or city friends. I love talking. Is there anything more enjoyable? Did I lose control / have no self-control of talking? As a child I had no self-control of playing games. Later, I had none for talking. Communication (no matter through medium or human language) *is* life. It is dialectical. Other media are not. But **games are special, in that they are [dialectical].** I have no control over my **desire for communication**. I want to talk all night, but people don't want to talk about the things that I do. My friends didn't want to go explore places at times. It was just me, my idea, my desire. Later, people didn't want to go to the events that I did, nor the media I consumed, and slowly, it became only media, especially in the suburbs, that I could talk to. But that wasn't the only choice, I could have talked to the people nearby; In retrospect, one can [sea?] find more people, more neighbors, more city spaces and organizations. Instead, I turned to media. Was it because I lived in a suburb? Is it an urban problem? Cultural? My own? Did I not consume media in NY? No [, I didn't]. I seeked people. **In cities I seek people to do things with. That the point of a city. People exist [within proximity]. And someone is there to talk to at every moment, about anything.**

old thought:
life is no fun without a hostel full of diverse people going about their own free ways.
  - then to emulate such an environment is a goal

organizing material vs organizing people
  - a topic to blog about

accumulate? Just enough, no more. Can commute via scooter. But need air conditioner, hot shower, etc.

move headphone notes to a head-fi post

only social matters are never material, no games, no business, just people -- hostels, events, talking, to anyone

1. music
2. future - farm / rural gigs
  - can get money from city, or tutor English from my house
  -- a house
3:
organizing in a city, as a group, versus organizing individually, accumulating capital.

  - or is it the depression / melancholy simply from not being social, not being able to talk to someone?
  -- How did I survive as a child? I have no idea. Playing games? Riding my bike? Music? Film? that's no life. That's awful. I *need* people. I *want* to be new [kids?]. Looking back at my childhood, I just can't imagine how I survived. Computer? After school I did get to play with Matt, Michael, Mike, Jacob, etc. But after that? Media. I didn't explore people, people's minds. It was mindless material organization. Shower, school, then finally get to think.

[note: pasted this paragraph to Philosophy of Music]
Music is awful. It blocks thinking. Gives energy, for physical exercise, but actions are not thought of, just taken. It blocks thinking before taking an action. The decision-making phase is skipped. Is this action? Is this life? How can such mindlessness be? How wild the affects of music are.

[todo: should add to Childhood and Media and This Recent Lonely Phase]
To do anything without people seems so absurd. My past, America, American culture. Though Taiwan (and Asia) cultures make it difficult to be independent, to create art, to explore, etc. It is absolutely better than the alternate, opposing choice. To be with others *is* an experience. [To maximize that time is the culture's categorical imperative](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/capitalistic-behavior). That's how it should be. **Societies don't develop without spending time with each other.** It's the time we spend with each other that creates experience, and hopefully, wisdom. **America's media-consuming culture merely adds information; Taiwan's creates experiences.** I've lived lifetimes in Taiwan. I'm not sure if my life-time in America even counts. I had to figure out what it was to be human in the cities (SF, NY). I seeked humans, social life, exploring art together. Perhaps I only know work, not life. I didn't spend time talking to people as I did with my friends during childhood. Have I ever? Have I ever talked to people normally? I don't think so.

## older paper:
Then what should be taught, if anything can be? Nothing. Just communicate with children freely. One doesn’t need to yeah something [specific?]. People learn on their own. Just **give them access to reality**, to [c?] knowledge** (Wikipedia), and **through play they will explore, and during times of organization they will create — learning by doing.**

The culture of school is hegemonic, already at the elementary grade school levels the politics of he nation affect the social development of people, by selecting what is taught, and re-enforcing it with authority, either by authority of the school, the parents, and/or society (government, exclusion, etc.), then it is further pressured by the cultural norms of society.

The only way out is to ignore it all, not worry Let people say, try to authorize, try to pressure — but do not worry. **Give a child an environment in which they do not worry, and they will find the real worries of the world on their own.** Give the opposite environment, and they will merely worry about what their society worries about. An American child may worry about getting money to buy a house. An Asian child may worry about their own education (and still fail to learn). An aboriginal may worry about their land/home — it’s material. Whatever the culture, **by not worrying, one develops ones own culture**, one’s own ethics, politics, **one’s own worries**.

Therefore, for the ideal social development of a child, there must be access to rarity, access to organization, no authority on what is to be taught, a worry-free environment — **freedom**.

## older paper:
Need music to be happy alone. Is that how I survived before? During my childhood? From such a young age. How can being alone at *this* age be *this* bad? Because since I’ve left America I’ve been *so* social. So simple. So happy. Going my way, yet having people to come to to: a hostel. That’s it. That’s all that’s needed. Not much. A few people to talk to.

When I was young, who *did* I talk to? I didn’t write much thoughts down while I was in 10th grade, so, all communication, verbal or written, was near nil. I used AOL instant messenger specifically. The same later applied to Facebook. Sometimes I’d talk all night using those programs — Facebook messages, not posting / reading. I didn’t talk to people over the phone. If I called someone, it was short — I didn’t hod conversations, group. I’d do the work, play games with people — I communicated through my actions.

I think those messenger programs were crucial in allowing me to communicate in a non-immediate (time) way. I’d think and write. Sometimes at length. People would even later see that I’m typing, whenever AOL added that feature. It may have annoyed people. [**Why?**] Was it my indecisiveness? No care for social activity? Did not value it? How did I obtain so much knowledge? Through media and travel (with my bike)?

When people talk, the human language narrows through sometimes what is communicated, much information is lost — perhaps I preferred the vastness of visual communication: of travel, games, and films. They satisfied me. Talking did not.

In prioritizing visual communication, is one irrational, for not actively letting the mind select what is inputted, aware of? Was Aristotle right in the beginning of his metaphysics? — is visual the most powerful sense? And did I not will to control it?

In prioritizing visual communication, is one irrational, form to actively letting the mind select what is replied, aware of? Was Aristotle right in the beginning of his metaphysics? — is visual the most powerful sense? And did I not will to control it?

Or was visual selected, because that’s reality. One can’t learn much through inferior mediums. **I selected reality**, and I never stopped. Even just recently with the discovery of history, my mind fights to historicize, and during high school, by selection of [more?] towards social reality (New Wave films). **All of school was not reality.** It didn’t involve observing people, nor were the methods of teaching visual. How can one accept ideas without seeing it in reality? That is the definition of [blank]. **schools [space] children**. There is no space or time allotted for them to question what is being taught.

**consume less, art more**
  - [like] Humans of Taiwan
  - social / political
public art, social interaction, social intervention, digital media
to organize socially and urban

older paper with Ivar’s recommendation letter:
[todo: to film ideas]
mix walking with dialog with it
mix interviews?
series of films testing film medium

[todo: to film ideas]
Look at Taipei from elephant mountain (single shot). Talk about how the city came to be, and the people’s singular culture (few quick shots). end!!! That’s what I like about the people, they don’t use much media. Unfortunately that’s just one culture. How would a multi-cultural place look like? Turn camera toward waterfall.

hidden cam videos of cultural problems:
perception of homeless people
convenient store ethics
police ethics at railway station
Christian food place time / ethics
Humans of Taiwan
  - homeless people, migrants, etc.
  - continue Humans of Taiwan for cultural problem (ideology, hegemony, etc.)***
the art of critical theory
  - Chris Marker style docs
