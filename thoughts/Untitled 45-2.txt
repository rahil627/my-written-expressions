# list of reasons to appeal

problems with the police arrest:
Because the accuser is a police officer, he is treated much better than me, especially during the arrest. While I am restrained, the accuser is free.

- At the scene, while I am being arrested, the accuser is free to talk to the witnesses.
- At the police station, while I am restricted from taking photos, the accuser is free to take photos of his body, carefully taking off his jacket.
- Also at the police station, while I am being interviewed, the accuser is in the same room, listening. (I don’t quite recall exactly when the accuser came in...)
- That night, while I am at the detention center cell healing up, the accuser is free to run to the hospital. I am not free until the next evening, without my motorcycle keys. Two days after my arrest, I am also told that I am forbidden from riding my motorcycle.

Thus, while the accuser is free to create his evidence, I am arrested, jailed, and then restricted from riding my only motorcycle.

problems with the police after the arrest:
During the time of the court procedure (these past 6 months), the police, likely from the same police station, have made my life difficult in various ways. Intentional or not, these events have negatively affected my life greatly.

- The police mis-informed me.
- The police defamed me.
- The police intimidated me, and still do.

Only after the trial (after 5 months), I have been able to live elsewhere.

problems with the local court procedure:
- **During the trial, my defense was accidentally ended early by the translator.**
- **During every hearing (including the police interview), I am not allowed to provide my own testimony. It is always translated and then transcribed by other people. I am not allowed to bring my own translator to the hearings or write my own testimony.**
- During the trial, the photos of the scene were not provided. It is obvious that the photos exist: The accuser is using a photo of my motorcycle as his evidence!
- During the trial, only one witness was provided—the same witness that the accuser chose. There were at least two main witnesses, and perhaps a few more that came later. When the witness did not appear, I initially felt that the court did not provide him because I went to the family mart and know him. Now I feel that just because I know him should not make a difference. We are not friends.

problems with the verdict
Because there were so many problems with the entire procedure, the verdict does not make any sense at all.

- The verdict says that I changed my testimony. In reality, the public prosecutor wrote my testimonies for me. The public prosecutor also changes my testimonies, perhaps due to mis-understandings. I have never even had the chance to provide my own testimony!
- Neither the accuser nor the customer witness can recall the incident in detail.
- The customer witness altered his testimony according to my testimony. At the first hearing, he says that I jumped off of my motorcycle and attacked the police officer (my motorcycle is parked; there is a photo of it). Then, after hearing some of my testimony (at the first hearing), he changes it during the trial.
- The customer witness greatly exaggerates during the trial, saying that we were really fighting, punching. The accuser and I both agree that we only restrained each other. It is obvious that the customer witness is nervous during the questioning, unable to recall any details, and even makes up lies when I keep asking him for details.
- The verdict says that I had a chance to mediate. If there was, nobody told me. I was accused the same night of the incident and taken to the investigator’s court the next day.


# conclusion
[insert old conclusion about fair trial here]

This case is mostly about lack (or perhaps inability) of communication, lack of professional behavior, lack of police training, and sheer prejudice. I believe the the main reason that the police have mis-informed me, defamed me, and still intimidate me, are the same reasons the accuser did: The police in my district simply do not communicate. They all take action without communication. They wait out-side my home, but do not tell me why. They tell my neighbors about the incident, but not me. They come *all the way* to my own home to tell my friends about the incident, but not to me (I was *just* inside). Similarly, the accuser restrains and tackles me, without giving me any warning. Because Tainan’s police do not communicate, everything they do becomes a problem. They just do whatever they want to do, without ever telling you why. It is a really strange and very wrong behavior, unique to certain people in Tainan. Even Japan’s police in rural areas are able to say “No!”, “Stop!”, “Halt!”, or make an “X” hand gesture!

I hope there is someone at the district court that is able to listen to my own testimony and allow me to bring my own competent translator so that I can defend my-self.
