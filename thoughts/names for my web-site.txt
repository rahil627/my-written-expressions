**rathewolf + willowolf**
  - this is the best combo I’ve got so far
  - It’s more personal than the generic wolfoftheway / wayofthewolf
  - [life component].rathewolf + [species].willowolf

wolfoftheway.com
  - keep this for sub-domain flexibility
  - the ‘wolf’ is meaningless, but with sub-domains...
  - more conceptual at the cost of abstraction
  - rathe.wolfoftheway.com?
  - willo.wolfoftheway.com? (willofthe.wolfoftheway.com)
    - one domain for everything seems neat though

wolf.com
  - ra.wolf.com, sun.wolf.com
  - fuck, this domain is killer

x/willothewolf
old:
wolfoftheway + wayofthewolf
 - [species].wolf, [area].way
wolfoftheway + willofthewolf
  - diy.will, natural.will, visual.will

will is a strong intention or desire, i will succeed. So, it includes my intentions. That works really well for my personal public-oriented projects.
way is a path or method / style / manner (of doing something). So, it’s more about the way I (or we should) do things, or, the path I took / am taking. I’m not too sure how that would fit for web projects... It seems to only fit a biography or a sort of ethics, like daodejing, documenting good ethics, documenting natural tools, etc. Hmm, yeah, so it works too.

Way is what I feel people should do. Will is what I desire and intend to do.

Will ‘o something, I feel, combines the two. It’s a way, for people to be directed toward, but it’s also the will of that something. It’s the will of the wisp that guides you toward some path. It’s the will of the wolf. It’s the will of the island wolf. So, will ‘o is a completely new meaning.

sub.willowolf allows me to alter the kind of wolf, therefore, altering the kind of will. A forest.willowolf may guide you toward more natural living ideas. A natural.willofthewolf ...just sounds really generic. Species adjective doesn’t work with will. A natural.wayofthewolf is better. A forest.wayofthewolf also nearly works! [area] way is alright: mountainous way, sandy way, marshy way. [Area] will doesn’t work. Mountainous will of the wolf. It must be an adjective of will. So, the way might be better than the will, but will’o is better than both!

## typo-handling
rahthewolf.com
  - I think people think of Ra not Rah, unless it’s a sound.

## re-directs
mainly for ease...telling people to go to my name.com
rahil.com
rahil.site
  - $28, not worth it
rahil.space
  - $18, not worth it
rahilthewolf.com
  - I might use this as my user-name, to replace rahil627 for front-facing social media, so...worth having.
  - this is better for personal contacts, but, rathewolf is easier to remember for most people (including those that speak other languages)

## domain priority
1. rathewolf
2. willowolf
  - **also works in other languages: ranglang, maborosi...**
4. rahilthewolf
  - beats rahil.site / rahil.space?
   - yeah, I think so!
5. wolfoftheway / waywardwolf
  - the.wolfoftheway or ra.wolfoftheway for my personal site? It doesn’t make much sense...
7. wayofthewolf
  - domain is currently taken

## a note
guardian.wolfoftheway works really well

willowolf only works if willowolf is a kind of wolf. A guardian willowolf is the (visual) representation of the will of a guardian wolf.

willowolf feels ambiguous, path, individualist, melancholic

guardian.wolfoftheway
guardian.willowolf
guardian.waywardwolf

hmmm... sub.wolf... works really well.

forest.wolfoftheway
forest.willowolf
forest.waywardwolf

here, I think forest willowolf is actually quite good. It sounds like a kind of wolf. Although guardian wolf of the way was the best, here, forest wolf of the way doesn’t work as well. Forest wayward wolf also doesn’t work quite as well either.

hungry.wolfoftheway
hungry.willowolf
hungry.waywardwolf

all work fine here

indian.wolfoftheway
indian.willowolf
indian.waywardwolf

all work fine, though, I like the last two a bit more

island.wolfoftheway
island.willowolf
island.waywardwolf

yeah, for environments, willowolf sounds nice. Wayward wolf doesn’t sound unique enough. It just sounds like a wayward wolf, an adjective. Willowolf is unique enough to have that pokémon effect.
