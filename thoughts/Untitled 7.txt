I saw the world today.

From my motorcycle.

The most beautiful sunset I’ve ever experienced, and, I didn’t even have a camera on me. Perhaps the only time I really just sat there and watched the sun set because how comfortable the weather was, and how exhausted I was to do anything else.

One can see the world from a bicycle in the suburbs. One can see the world simply using one’s feet in the city. But in rural areas, one needs a motorcycle.

The first two are free. The last one requires a bit of money.

Then, why is it that the world sits at home looking at screens?

I turned to the screen because I didn’t have money. My body was trapped too, tired, unable to move too much in the burning sun and dirty humidity.

Now, I consume the world again. The visa run keeps me in check every three months. The  sunny weather and fall winds keep my body healthy and moving about. This is life. **Consuming the world and putting it into art.** It feels good, again.

Can I find work with $50nt ($1.66)? Not so sure. Wasted it on the previously-mentioned motorcycle ride, lol.

I didn’t see any signs for work in the smaller towns south of the city. I wasn’t looking too hard either though. Maybe they do exist?

The towns below Tainan are beyond ancient. The things there barely constitute what it is to be human.

...Yet, it feels so damn good being in rural areas. The feel is great. I am at peace. I can play in the sand like the children in those areas do. I can play!

It doesn’t antagonize me nearly as much. It makes me...complacent? Less conscious of all the ugly. It’s not as in-your-face as cities are. It doesn’t nudge you as much. Oh
