[a short **history** of playing games, then making, then watching, then playing again]
I grew up playing games with friends in my beloved suburban neighborhood, playing cooperatively or competitively, nearly always together. Later, during the *Melee* years, I even sludged through school with the intention to balance art (games) and money, carefully avoiding bad guys (military contractors). After that, I moved to cities to join game (as art) and “new media” art communities (think: Fluxus, Situationist), notably one in New York. And after that, I slowly drifted away from the ideologies of developed America, wandering the world, joining and creating communes, trying to do good: you know, the hippie sorts of love and anarchy, sharing and caring (remember having to share video game consoles? :) :) ), working together, living rather primitively, being overly conscious of the environment and its materials, etc.
