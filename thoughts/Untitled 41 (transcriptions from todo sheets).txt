something like a Casio CTK-2400
  - doubles as midi input device
  - $100 new
  - **no USB** —??
  -> then can move to Akai, or even use both together: one for drums and other instruments, while keeping the Casio for piano input
  -> then can ditch it for a better midi keyboard

other Casio models
  - 2500 and 2550 are about the same as the 2400, and not worth the extra money
  - 3200 **adds touch**
  - **3500, $130**
  - 4400 adds 6 track recorder, but becomes 20lbs! —yikes!
  - 6200 adds 16 track recorder —midi is a way better decision in the digital age
  - 7200 adds 64-key polyphony!

Yamaha PSR E363
  - 10lb, too heavy
Yamaha YPG 235

Casio Privia PX-350
Yamaha “Piaggio” NP 12 or 32
