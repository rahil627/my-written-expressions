feeling:

the day after?:
Bought some more cheap usb batteries from the thrift shops. Also bought a cheap bluetooth speaker. I even spotted quite a quality tablet stand! It’s amazing what a small amount of money can buy [still can buy another usb battery, if it’s good]. Playing Wang-Fei at the shack; Feels like home. This is how the Place of Arts was from the beginning to the end: a peaceful bliss in the southern heat. Finally. Getting to that bliss again. Slowly.

Next: Still need to score some temporary work. Today, I must check my Wells Fargo account. Perhaps I will update Dhananjay and Shila soon too. I must keep going.

Home is not so bad anymore, now that it’s cool at night. Not so sure what to do during the day; Still physical work? What’s left, other than buying another usb battery? Not much. I’m ready to work again. It took a few days, but I’m cleaned up again, better than ever. The August crisp coolness has created the perfect environment for working, at least, at night.

Will I be able to find work, being unable to for the past year in the past? Who knows.



the next day?:
After the evening nap I went out again. At night the world feels like it’s my house. The rural area between my beach shack and the gold coast all feels small townsy. The land feels close. The gold coast’s beach, the critters in my shack, the rural-ness between. The clean air of the season makes everything feel great, crisp, clean. In this mood I am fear-less. People don’t alter my behavior. I am not living up to anyone’s expectations. I’m at home.

The air-conditioning at the rural library was un-settling. The air-conditioning at my local library was much better, but still, being there isn’t nearly as good as being on these beaches. I really need to make a lot more mosquito spray and invest in mobile internet. Being on these beaches is perfect. The perfect work-space. The perfect place to do some programming. The perfect place to play some music. It’s peace.

Can I find work within a month? Or should I wait for the construction working surfer to reply? A month on the beach is a lot of good computer time. Yeah, **buy mobile internet.** I can even drink home-made teas and coffee, not even wasting money on drinks. It’s perfect. Buy a bunch of thrift shop usb batteries too. Then I’ll probably only have 2000$ left. Though, mosquitos will still surely be a problem, as they are now, biting me. Hmmmmm, maybe not so peaceful, hah. Close. Anyway, the only library open late is Tainan University’s, and that’s only ‘til 10pm, and, they don’t provide internet. The other smaller libraries all close between 5 to 9pm, making them useless at night. The beach is quite okay during the day-time, I think, without mosquitos. I can just hang out in one of those bamboo sheds if I need some shade. Take a few bottles of water, a power bank, mobile internet, and I’m good! Still have to go to the bhuddist restaurant to eat though. Sucks. Having to go through the terrible city just to eat... Not much can be done about that...perhaps cereal? Will need money, and lots of it.

One month of beach-office? Sounds good. Have to spend most of the time there though, not at work-places. Not sure how that would happen.

It’s a wild phenomenon. Social life and computering. In a library, I don’t feel like using the computer to socialize because the environment is not suitable for it. Instead, I must use a computer to socialize in social places, like third spaces, public places, sociable open places. In the midst of that social environment, then I can socialize with precisely the people that I want to [through digital communication]. In this sociable environment, I feel at ease, able to pass time with others, able to live, simply, feebly, with no hurried feeling; And, the beach can be one of those places. I hope.
-

Ahhh, a much better set-up: on the motorcycle, facing the coast. This is the life! Yeah, I definitely need mobile internet, and those extra power banks. Try avoiding buying tea and cola. Instead, stick to nature, water, and home-made drinks. No need for the other junk. I only drink the other junk because I have to eat so much at the bhuddist kitchen, and have to go through the god-damn city to get there [todo: take a more scenic path to the bhuddist kitchen]. Ugh. Can’t wait to be able to afford some cereal. Cereal [oatmeal and banana? This actually may compete with the commute cost of going to the bhuddist kitchen. Gas may cost 10 to  15 per trip. Maintenance, more. Buying kilos of bananas is a good idea.], vitamin. Fuck going through that city. I’ll sacrifice my diet.

Anyway...Can I maintain peace, accumulate wealth, without a computer? It sure does seem difficult. I’ll have to try messaging the shit out of the world these next few days. The more peaceful the work the better. Stick to the peaceful flow. Transition into busking peaceful music and somehow projecting nature into the artificial (get a projector!). No need to consume anything out here. Just water, mosquito spray...zzz.

Hmmm, the power banks are needed for busking anyway. It’s a good investment. Even the shitty Chinese ones in the thrift stores. If rain gets to them, oh well. More important are my equally shitty charging adapters.

Hmmm, yeah. Busking at the train station then riding out to the beach every-day seems like a great routine. Pingdong doesn’t have the beach. Or the mountains. Everything is far. At least Tainan has this little bit o’ nature.

Getting back into Voice Dream seems great too. As is applying to programming jobs. All seems well, thanks to a little money...now, I really really have to score that next temporary job.

I think the next month should involve looking for temporary work, doing them, photo-copying my writings, transcribing my writings, perhaps even blogging, who knows. Such peaceful weather...The home is fine. Just remember to spray insecticide every now and then. Other-wise, until it gets cold, it’s fine!

Yeah... I don’t want to deal with people, time. Programming and busking are some of the few time and people independent work, along with writing, media-making, crafting, and so on. It’s time to become a loner again, as I was when I was young.

Anyway... time to sleep. Get those usb-batteries tomorrow (I can even buy those usb accessories now, like the usb-fan or the usb-light!), then mobile internet, then the talking begins, for money.

Next first purchase: iPhone vs one-way flight vs midi-to-iOS-device cable (to begin using the Akai).

If I run out of money, I can try selling the Akai, wired Apple keyboard, and other thrift store items. A trip to Gaoxiong sounds peaceful. I wouldn’t mind that during the day. But, to make my way back on the same day, might be tiring. Also, riding around in yet another (Taiwanese) city will suck.

Hmmm...lots to do. ‘Til next time, diary!

the next day:
After a few days of cleaning up (3?), I took the motorcycle out of town again, to a library in a rural town, at night. Though the ride was a good change / feel, the library was not worth it: old people, though a surely local feeling (forgot that one word...parochial?), there’s no interactive energy, synergy, people energy: it’s just me.

Tomorrow, with a free day, done cleaning everything, I can relax at the local library, which just happens to be the best library in this wretched city. Just me, this iPad, some relaxing music... Ahhhh... can’t wait!

I was thinking about the trading idea... It might simply be better to do a labor job than it. Trading really does require quite a lot of effort, and, if I don’t have good trades, then it’s going to suck trading chump change. Compare that to a steady 1000NT+ per day without thought, with people. Hmmm, not sure... Maybe it just sucks to work alone.

Even better still is to simply teach. At 600-1200NT per teaching sessions or 500NT online for a short session, it defeats 8 hours of labor and however much time of trading handily. Trading could only win if I can quickly make turn-overs. Otherwise, it will require me waiting for sales. Also, it’s social! So, it’s really not *that* bad, is it? I still have to check if Planett is running. If not, I can try the local Fablab! Still, before checking both of those, I may have to even check if I can use that website to teach! Who knows what it entails...

So, my current options: trading, labor (construction, etc.). After doing these first two, I might have enough to buy a music keyboard and cable, though, even this is not guaranteed. Still, I can search for more work in Tainan and Taidong, search for teaching work in Taidong, ask Simone how much longer his teaching jobs are for... Lots of searching. A mix of daily-paid labor work and trading seem best for now. Can mix in busking later. Can even mix in app-based teaching too; Comparing all four. Then, can decide if I can really make a move to the east side and not be poor. Trading there would suck, probably requiring the internet to trade (hence why flea markets and such shops are only in the cities.)! Finding labor work will also suck, though, perhaps, less so than traditional Tainan as there would be less discrimination, maybe even more than average acceptance! That just leaves the teaching app and busking. Busking would be limited too, to that one spot in Taidong. Hualian may have some spots, but it’s probably not as solid as that one in Taidong. Thus, money would be really really limited. Basically, just computer work and night markets, once I get into that. Searching for work would also suck without a proper home. Though, a tent may do...

Yeah, all I really desire is to work with complete peace and comfort, and to do that means working at or near home. The trading and labor seem fine for now, until I can find a work-space for the teaching app and equipment for busking.

Still, all of this work sucks. The city is much better. Much better people. People willing to work together. Way more egalitarian. Way less traditional. Fun. Humane.

In Taidong, I want to be in media mode. In my own world. The world of concepts and conceptual arts. That’s all. I don’t want to be bothered by doing all this other junk work. I just want peace, nature-loving animations, rural trains, trips to the rivers. The rest, the rest should be media art... I really need to get into film-making... and what about community? Egalitarian values? SI? Well, I think that will come naturally...with the readings ‘n all...

**So, first, ask that one guy for construction work and Simone for teaching work (though inform Simone that I’m going to try some teaching apps), if not, look for some labor work using Tainan Facebook pages, making sure to block all those that do not respond with good values. Then, try trading using Lvtian. Try spending 1000$ on the local shops, then selling it all on Lvtian. Then third, [check costs of work-spaces in Tainan] begin using the teaching app that Holly recommended me (though need to buy internet or a work-space to actually teach. Work-space vs shack? Perhaps the shack is actually okay, I just have to be at the shack on-time, and, during rainy days, make sure my solar lamp is working for an indoor class.[—ohhhh nooooo, I just realized that the video communication may eat up battery. I can’t do this without electricity. The work-space is necessary at first]). Try to charge the iPad every-day. Though, I’m not sure how during rainy days.**

Expenses: 1000$ for trading. 700$+ for monthly internet. 1500-3000$+ for monthly work-space (including internet, electricity, and a cozy place to do computer work, socially, and warmly).

one day:
felt great riding the motorcycle around town, napping at the shack, going to the library at night (although it was closed), and again at the swing on the beach. This is freedom, and it is necessary for me. Although I don’t have my laptop anymore, unable to get a decent paying job without it, and, barely able to get by otherwise; this much freedom is the base of my desires. Life starts from this foundation.

Tomorrow, if the weather is good, I think it may be best to start with a small-town library, charging my iPad, drinking tea, taking some snacks, checking small-town libraries for wifi, using it to sell the other keyboard, checking costs of products, and mapping out shops and markets. Traveling to shops and markets in rural areas would keep me in my happiest environemnt: on the rural roads. The library along the beach to the south seems like a good start.

1000$ per day. Is that feasible? If I eat lunch for free or 20$, tea for 20-30$, gas for 50$, oil for 300$, maybe. Gas would be a problem. As will oil. As will drinks. Really must check ruten.com for street prices to get a gauge and become familiar with the site, perhaps connnecting my account to it, or, getting familiar with the closest 7-11 or family mart and post office. For now, I think the street prices of Apple products is good enough to sell nationally. Later, I can try selling them internationally for more money, and, as a way to send money to my American bank.

Is 4000$ enough to start with? $1000 is probably only enough for two weeks! That would only leave 3000 to buy stuff. Shit. I also need some money to lock the room! Hmmm... Well, if not, can try selling the MIDI player for $3000. That might take time though, especially compared to the Apple products.

Good water bottles may be worth checking out. As are good helmets. Anything that stands out as a good deal, really. Japanese household products?

The internet part of the work will suck: taking a picture, putting it online, writing in Chinese, etc. Also, checking to see if it sells, checking e-mails every-day. Really might need to buy mobile internet! Nah, I still woudln’t have electricity and still need to go to library to charge the iPad. Hmmm. I guess that would have to wait until I have a decent power bank.

now:
repair rear basket bottom?
  - check it again, is it just the natural meterial or the metal part that is broken?
    - natural material, but, there’s only one metal bar on the bottom!? No cross-bar? Strange. Can update it with a metal cross bar...or even a bottom plate

water container
  - check warehouse for one?
    - ew. Nah. I bought a new one. A good one. As water is super important. Though, I should have taken more time to clean it.

need wifi
  - library’s wifi is abused
  - family mart’s 1 Free Wifi network requires posting Facebook, try with a suspended account? Hate to throw passwords out like that though.
    - use iTaiwan near the shack quickly, then continue the day trip!
  - **check for public wifi at the gold coast**
  - or, find the best small town library

1. sell pottery
  - take picture of pottery x2
  - map shops
    - nope, none in Tainan? Strange. How else to check? Surely ther are many. Perhaps a gardening shop?
  - go to all, ask if they buy
    - if not, try selling online

2. huanbao thrift store
  - no deals there. Just that nice backpack. But I’d rather buy another HK-Pro.
  - test the usb battery. Check the main thrift store for better batteries. Really should just buy one online. It’s a good investment. It really makes life more worry-free too.
    - this way I can stay at the shack, live locally, and consume almost no money or resources. Stay home. Though, I still need internet. :/

3. eat at 5:30’ish
  - get sleepy when I eat at this time. Need a nap after it and the heat.
x/use library or family mart at night
4. take break by going to the beach or riding the motorcycle to rural areas
  - beautiful weather right now. Best season.
6. use iPad at night at the beach?
  - do all work at the beach. Take a jacket. Take the mosquito spray. Make more mosquito spray.

$:
store 3000$ to the bank
keep 1000$ for small expenses
  - $300 per good quality oil (Sym 20/50 non-synthetic or 10/40 synthetic). Can try running it past 1000km and inspect the color of the oil myself.

teaching:
1. ask Simone, just to try, for fun, especially if it’s temporary. Inform of leaving the triple oobasan employed job.
weekly. check Taidong
  - not sure how. The normal job sites, sure, but also just directly contact public schools? Perhaps ask them how? Or just buxibans?

teaching app:
need a good work-space
  1. - **check Planett**
  - research work-spaces on the east-side

labor:
1. ask that one surfer mutual friend for construction work
weekly. check online (Facebook, mostly) for temporary labor (cuGong) work
  - after getting a consistent temporary job, can tinder-fuck females

Taidong work:
weekly. check online for work in Taidong (Facebook and job banks)
  - just need one job for one month, tea shop, pizza hut, etc. A contemporary job without ancient traditional people

trading:
4. map all flea markets, second-hand shops, research some on Google in the Tainan county area
  - the main one (Bubu, tiaoMiDangPu)
    - bbbobo.com.tw(?), can check website if they sell things online? Or, if they have inventory for each shop...
    - mainly, check for locations: 1. Tainan 2. anything close to Tainan?
      - if not, then I must take a trip to Gaoxiong’s shops, doing a full day, one day, then, come back and sell everything. Hopefully spending 1000$ and making at least double?
   - Jiayi has one? Pingdong has one? Gaoxiong has a bunch.
  - large, once-a-week or once-a-month types
  - DongMen (? ask the bbbobo people for the name of that shop)
  - the type of store that I went to
    - warehouse?
  - **buy a usb battery!!!**

another problem is working without mobile internet. It would be lovely to work on the beach, but, without that much money, it’s going to suck catching office-like libraries and convenient stores. It takes me quite a bit of time to get into computer mode in such dull places. Really need music and warmth. **Perhaps checking natural places for public wi-fi is the best choice.** Another good choice is my local public library in Anping, which is possibly the best one in Tainan! Get cozy in one of those desks, or the first floor... Then, do the computer portion of the work.

I think as a start, it would be best to just do the two Tainan shops: bbbobo and huanbao. See if I can profit from that. If not, then I must be on the look for work again. Still, I have a lot of other options to try anyways, so..., going to my local library is a must. Do a full library day one day, after a day of Tainan shopping.

Check the Apple cable costs at the family mart before leaving tomorrow. Buy them all. Try to sell them all.

rural library. sell wired Mac keyboard online
3. check street cost of Apple display port cable and the other cable they had


check roll-up keyboard cost
   - research reviews and brands too
   - check what brand the shop has
check cost of expensive appliances?
  - bottles, cooking pots, blenders, etc.?
2. check pottery shops for a similar pot to mine, then ask pottery shop owners if they buy, or know places that buy them


goal:
trade until I have 6000$ to buy a keyboard, then can begin trading and busking together, while traveling slowly



drink ginger tea with brown sugar every-day during the heat
  - clean the newly bought steel bottle (again, with a scrubber)
    - trash the starbucks one? Or, sell it to the flea market? Sell it. Keep the aluminum one for quick-cooling of hot drinks.
buy Coke Zero
check battery cost at the general store, compared with 25ntd HeWei (chinese company)
  - 40ntd MagiCell at specially selected item store
  - internet-research both products

  - dry clothes on the wooden cargo platforms? vs buy steel or plastic hangers
    - nah, don’t need hangers! Just use my rope.
use old shirt as an in-side door-mat
  - cut the sleeves, keep it 2-ply? Nah, cut it, to make two door-mats.
   - use the sleeves to wipe the motorcycle
     - if the other shirt is also un-washable, then use that to clean to motorcycle too, or, my backpack
  - should internet research how to get rid of moldy clothing
find some new card-board to replace the out-side door-mat
  - get two more pieces for the front of the house (outside the house) and the back entrance (to the main room, inside the house)
  - found it. One is being used as a trash can, the other can be used for out-doors-mats
get a mirror (from the warehouse)
put the bed back?
  - ask A-Liang for help here
**put the bed on the floor** (but must spray insecticide inside and outside the house once a week)
  - I think this will make me much more productive, working with my back against the wall, or, simply on the floor, ready to get out and do things, in a better position to think and do.
  - then sweep the floor
    - and mop the floor
      - use artificial soap and water to mop with? Or just water? Water first. Then the soap.

tea shop couple (1000 gift)
bhuddist kitchen (1000 per cook gift)

repair motorcycle (day-time chores and exercise):
1. tape broken plastic part again
  - add more tape
    - try making a cute ‘x’ design or a patch design
5. tape any other broken parts (clean areas before taping, to give a good seal)
  - tape the seat for now, until I can stitch it.
7. hand-wash with sponge and the artificial soap (not the green scrubber! That would definitely scratch the wax and even the natural paint)
  - use the bucket to mix soap and water
  - use the hose to spray the motorcycle down
8. spray anti-rust stuff on the rusted metal parts.
  - after some time, remove anti-rust goo with a tissue
  - try brushing rusted metal parts with anti-rust goo with a metal brush
    - can probably use that green scrubber for this, especially the wheel spokes
buy motorcycle chain (1000)
  - should wait for that one dude to reply, see if I can get him to help repair
  - also should just wait until it breaks; drive slow

check the other second-hand shops, one on dongMen?
  - try to stop by them all to buy everything needed, even ones out of the city

pack
  - clear the bed of my belongings
  - **hang the wind chime**
    - re-hang it with the black strings

  - pay Taifeng less, then use the rest to buy a one-way flight from Hualian

sun-dry th iPad case
put all writings in the plastic containers

later: invest in the best rolling bag, or, bag and trolly system


1. flight?
  - praise Jon again and again
  - too late for name problems? :(

repair bike
  - find a good bike repair person (check from Family Mart), x/bike to bhuddist kitchen everyday? Good work out. Also can stop to drink tea.
    - no way. The city is terrible, especially during rush hours. Motorcycle pollution galore. No peacefulness. This isn’t the farms.
      - give the bicycle to that one guy

make a looking for temporary work sign?

6. beach house to stay calm / piano music until Jon replies
  - play all dream pop

the problem really may be humidity. In humid weather I want to keep walking, moving, as staying still is gross.

computer time:
**e-mail that dude again for a new backpack and work**, update him
**message construction mutual acquaintance**,
  - remember to unfriend all fake friends once I have money!
update Mimi too
tabs
chrome
social media
IDs / website documentation
thoughts documentation (take notes from folder)
note new passwords / ?? and the lyrics ones
clean DropBox
clean Voice Dream
“leftover food goes here :)” sign
update iOS and apps

come back:
hitch-hike
**beg at train station**
  - people need work or money, don’t want gossip, food, or, discrimination
    - yes! this is one way. The other way is to steal (these feel great because they are active, productive, not depending sooo much on others)
      - really need to learn how to steal cars and scooters. So much easier in a place that doesn’t use a terrible written language...
  - beg whenever I feel like it, after dinner
    - 500-1000ntd is a day of work!
    - or after lunch, eating dinner at the other buffet restaurant
  - **buy toothpaste** and some second-hand shop stuff, including some cheap lighting
    - note: Salty toothpaste
    - try usb battery, usb fan, usb light combo
  - beg until I can go to the east? Same situation there. Need the computer work first. Then need to search for good housing (with electricity, hot showers, air conditioning, etc.). **AirBnB** might be better than hostels. Can still get cheap food from that one restaurant: go once a day, then store food in fridge, or, ask how long the food will stay fresh in the fridge, and eat it cold, whenever I want. (Can check for buddhist or church or meal kitchens), choosing a temporary home near that.
  - **pay back people, but don’t worry about it, as they’re not caring about you as a family would, they treat others like dogs, only giving food or $3.** The best people to pay are the semi-homeless people that helped you: the guy who gave the temple job, and the guy who introduced me to the church job. 1000 each? Nah, even that one guy earned more money from the temple than I did. So only owe one guy. Definitely should not pay an organization that is building a hospital.
  - can use Facebook from home / beach to look for temp. work
   - make Facebook profile secure, check myself on another account
  - win, win win win: begin teaching English application

charge usb-battery with plastic bag around it
**repair sleeping bag**
