Listened to some Wu-Tang Clan. 8 Diagrams was meh. Wu-Tang Forever was amazing. How did I not get into it when my brother banged it for years? Perhaps it rambled on too much, which the second disc lacking.

But those beats were perfected.

Anyway, had a long dream of getting a turntable set and recording at Village Motel over the weekends with my brothers. The first recording done by me, then with me and my brother, then the other brothers.

Dreams. Getting too far from reality?

It’s strange: the difference between communicating and physically doing things.

Perhaps, for the moment, I don’t want to talk, communicate, dwell; I just want to live.
