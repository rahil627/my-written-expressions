[1] During the trial, my personal defense was accidentally ended early by the court-provided translator. The translator told the judges that I was done. The judges then immediately exited through the back door.

I truly believe it was a miscommunication with the translator. Please ask the translator or watch a video of the end of the trial. Immediately after the judges leave, I ask my translator, “why did the judges leave?”. He told me that he thought I was done. I had only finished my first part.

Overall, the judges spent 85% of the time on questioning because the witness was late. I was given 15% of the time to defend myself, and then abruptly cut off. During that time I only had time to quickly describe the events in order to prepare for my arguments and state one argument. I had several more arguments to state.

The court provided me this translator because the court refused to allow me to bring my own translator.

The government organization, Legal Aid Foundation, promised me a lawyer appointment 11 days before the trial. On the appointment day, they informed me that they forgot to register some information. I immediately provided it. They did not communicate with me until after the trial. [See attached e-mails]

Every translator was so bad that I was forced to speak using my elementary Chinese, including during the main trial. I was also forced to sign every written testimony, despite not having time to read it completely, four different times.

I have been trapped in Tainan for 5 months, given perhaps 15 minutes to defend myself in a language I am not fluent in, and then abruptly cut off by a translator the court provided. Please think about this.

I only ask for a fair trial. I need time to defend myself in my own native language. Please give me time to defend myself and allow me to bring my own translator.
