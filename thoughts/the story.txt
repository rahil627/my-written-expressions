# the story of how this all began
A rainy cold front covered the beach-side shed I live in for what felt like a month (but was only a week?), without electricity save an outlet out-side to re-charge this iPad that I’m currently using to type all of this. The natural consequence? I watched videos on the internet of fighting game culture, notably, self-organized Melee tournaments, HyperX Showdown, and Evo 2018; And, I fell in love again.

Somewhere within Lil’ Majin’s performance with King, Sajam and Tasty Steve’s commentary of a Jenga match, the billion (50?) “side” competitions of nearly every fighting game in history that still has a community strong and willful enough to self-organize at the event, and, of course, the grassroots Melee tournaments, something happened.

I went though some sort of “It’s Real”[todo: which song?] (Kendrick Lamar, GKMC) moment, where I strangely felt that despite living a very different lifestyle and state of mind in the past few years, not consuming any media (save philosophy theses and concepts). I still love and miss the fighting game culture that I grew up on: the smack talk, the language (reflected through black-cultured commentators), *the game*, the creativity, and just hanging out with great friends and playing games: *The culture.*

There’s really no ethical justification for this project, as there isn’t for any form of entertainment, but mannnnnn, after so much moral seriousness, I sure do miss it. Surely there’s a place for all those play-ground games that we used to play.

This project was conceived on the first day sunlight and submitted 3 weeks later.
