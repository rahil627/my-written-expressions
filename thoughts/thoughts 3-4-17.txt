What makes an art work encapsulate the world? Make you want to explore it?

In Miyazaki's films [and other animated films], one runs and flies through fantastic worlds with the characters. In Final Fantasy games [and other RPGs], one travels fantastic worlds over-land, over-sea, and then flies over it. In the music of Final Fantasy, memories are evoked of places and characters within those worlds. In the music of Miyazaki's films, one's own memories are evoked.

After much real-world explorations, that same kind of music evokes place-times within the real-world: memories of explorations.

*That* kind of music is worth making; As is that kind of film and game.

A younger mind grasps the world through worldly art. An experienced mind attaches ideas from reality to the symbols and compares the worlds within film and game. The mind wanders through memories at simple strikes by piano keys, as it does to chimes of a wind-bell.

***That* provocation of wander is worth creating. To re-direct one's attention to the world.**

Do not dwell [into infinite criticism]: wander. Go back into the [real] world. Do things: live, explore, play, enjoy.

Be positive. [It's yours][Nas-It's-Yours] (and [Wu's][Wu-Tang-It's-Yours]).
