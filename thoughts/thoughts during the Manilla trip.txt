# On the way there (?):
**[The] best home is transportable, nomadic.**
  - camp and scooter (everywhere, everyday use), blue truck (outside huge cities)

**To have a dwelling otherwise, one needs to maintain connection with others.**
--

I think of Taibei, Tonghua linju. Walking around a pleasant, dense neighborhood. **No need to go anywhere -- everything is there, within a block. You wake up, you go out, and the city is yours: your focus, in your mind, yours.**

**The city is the space, to alter, shift around -- material and behavior. The city is a sandbox: try, document, try again.**

**Ideas are created for the sake of societal behavior, including the material environment. Constantly shifting. Not toward capital. Toward a better life - of convenience, naturalness, [stopped writing...?]**

But with all the people it becomes dark, polluted, artificial, exclusive. Luckily it doesn't cost anything to be on the streets.

At Place of Arts, **it was easy to think of natural-life-oriented-behavior.** In American cities, it was too. Taibei (for the most part) too. ***Better* if I had a scooter. How can one beat Taibei and a scooter? It's where everyone is, and access to much of the island!**

# On the way back:
**Public transport[ion systems] limits access to the world.** Poor transportation cripples a city. One is left to not move from one's place (neighborhood, and country).
  - Isn't that how places develop (socially organize)? By not moving?

Manilla is on par with Indian cities. It's public transport reminds me of Kuala Lumpur; It is chaotic, messy.
  - People sleep on the streets, with their kids. Small slum business owners sleep on a piece of cardboard behind their street-facing counter. Street vendors everywhere, especially around transport routes. Police have guns -- shotguns and semi-automatics in secure places, and pistols inside 7-11s.

**Slums are extremely competitive -- 2 pesos for a bun, 5 pesos for a bagged drink. Plastic is used as a cheap container. The low cost of plastic increases its productivity. The slums are the ultimate night-market [and neighborhood]. Extremely competitive arcades and internet rooms too. Individual-sized everything for varied tasting -- diversity.**
  - Everything is commodified: food, beverage, internet, and games.

The culture of the Philippines is similar to Lanyu and America: media-influenced, no thought -- basketball, pop-culture, **no thought / care for the environment / ecology**, quite different from Taiwan. They eat fast food: fried chicken; No care for health. Malls and fast-food are entertainment, much like the suburbs of America.
.
Rampant development, no governance in decision-making of city; Rampant capitalism. No care for society.
  - Queen Mellow's friend's office's rich neighborhood, Bel-Air, consists of one to two story suburb-like homes with gardens and pools, situated adjacent to a large block of huge hotels, whose alleys are red-light districts.
.
Enjoy chickenjoy. Mindless consumerism.
.
Filipino, Black, and Hispanic Americans typify American culture for me: free [in feeling: body and mind, art, language, etc.], media-educated, individual-capitalist, no solidarity [no holistic care or consensual decision-making for the entire society or ecology].
  - The streets even remind of areas where those cultures live in America: branded clothing stores, fried chicken shops, etc.

Back in Taiwan:
Taiwanese girls (all of them!) are beautiful. Perhaps a [rural lone wolf] nurse girlfriend would be nice?


systems
**Observe the world and plant ideas into it.**

All systems can be improved. No jobs exist to do so.
