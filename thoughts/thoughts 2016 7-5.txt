Map of Taiwan. Google satellite. Shows **beginning from 苗栗, cities become surrounded by nature. Feels good to live in any of them because it is reassuring that nature is not too far.**

**Fishing still interesting *because* it is contractual and natural.**

Still not interested in full-time English teaching for a long period of time.

Make cheap websites for local people.

Ask local day and night markets for work. Ask local English schools for part-time work.

Saw Banksy's book. Urge to make place-based art to increase awareness of everyday actions.

personally interested ideas from Wall and Piece:
nature / animals as main characters
police chalk / coke trail
small, tiny changes to the environment to alter messages
artificial parks - radioactive material in a lake, no swimming crocodile or sharks in water, or complete lack of nature
wasted food, material*
designated riot area (protect amendments)*
fat lane, trap door, unaware social classes
poems / writings in the correct place*
anti-corporate*
anti-authority
security cameras*, "what are you looking at", crows eating wire
salaryman-like mice
red carpet mouse hole for exclusivity*
good kid painted underground, doing bad vices
this is not a photo opportunity
aware of advertising images
"boring" on bland architecture*
image of TV being thrown out of a window
"I'm a celebrity, get me out of here" given to a money at a zoo*
graffiti in farm area, on farm animals
shopping cart vs primitive humans
corporate with poor Africans juxtaposition
branded characters misused
found object art, moving around.

Communication must be place-based to influence decision-making, and after conditioning, human behavior.

In a developed area, there are so many things materially wrong, that all one desires when one lives there is to politic, alter behavior. Thus, Bansky's art is a good method, to bring awareness, to everyday life, not just once, as in a media such as film, book, etc. **All art should be place-based.** **All communication should be place-based.** Need to look into land art.

Photos of actual farms and farm animals in front of meat shops. Traditional tea shop photo next to a corporate one. Anti-shopping malls. Pet shops. English prioritized. Migrant workers as slaves. Chinese tourism. Museum with Chinese works. Sculptures of historically powerful people. Taiwan politics. Care for Filipino elderly caretakers. Non-camp-able parks. Photographers with expensive cameras taking photos of artificial nature. 7-11. Taiwanese corporations. The city is full of social problems. Every social problem can be turned into place-based art.

But for more complex ideas? Can it show how people's minds develop? How people can come together and help each other? How to un-alienate the world?


4/12/2016 still at Taipei airport
from knowledge and education:
“*****missing an amazing writing of all prefectures, in Japanese language
  - it was amazing, worth finding and blogging about”

1/12/2016 at Taipei airport
A milligram of thought about space and people, the desire to be at or near home. Further thought out now: I often desire to stay close to my social connections, and do some kind of wage labour near them. Any further seems wrong. Is it? Is it wrong to get on a subway and transport one’s body so fast? I guess it’s that care for the material, environment. I know what’s around me, can alter it. Elsewhere, the ability to alter it feels difficult? Or is thought of less. The environment near home is cared for. Isn’t that irrational? Compared to taking care of people (as opposed to environment) or spending time doing some kind of specific work? The holistic approach of caring about everything nearby just feels right.

Slept late, woke up late. No social life. Just Fablab from 4-7pm. Fucking Japan.

**Claudio mentioned that he liked the try-fail culture of America, saying that Europe has a stigma not to just try.**

**Taiwan tries. Doesn't it? [Or was it just me?] Heck yeah it does.**

Yesterday I wrote:
> **But New York almost needs authority to keep power of certain cultures in check, whereas Taiwan doesn't: due to a non-power-hungry culture.**

**When should power be checked? When should people not try / "just do it"?**

**Mill says as long as it doesn't hurt others.**

**Thus, I just have to keep trying. Keep doing, making, creating, talking, trying to persuade or alter human behavior. To not try is to die.**
  - hmmmm, it seems my life's motivation is entirely political. Without other humans to affect, I die.

24/11/2016
More dreams. More sleeping in my sleeping bag in the cold. There's nowhere warm to go. All I can do is eat and sleep. Perhaps get to the library to charge my electronic devices. Laundromats are my cafes now, hoping for an electronic socket. It reminds me of a past life of mine, in San Francisco, and early New York, regularing comfortable spaces for me to make games, perhaps watch a film or read something. It was lifeless, cold. So cold.

*I need Taiwan.*

I think I'm feeling better though, finally. Feel ready to go back.

A recent daydream: of recreating the night at the Babycastles Wu-Tang event: Ida gives me a go pro like device attached to a headgear. I wear it and spill my thoughts, matchmaking for Jen, and generally pushing people together, being my normal self, of desiring people to interact, be more active, more physical. I spill my thoughts of Jen, and also write / record thoughts about games, education, meaning of the event, Kunal's skill, and perhaps more things.

These dreams take much time.

Hmmmm, long time no writing. Probably a good thing?

Oh another thought, from perhaps today or at least recently:
**The need to survive outside Japan, in the cold, is unreal. I can barely do anything but physically move. I can't think. All I am able to do is "work", not think. I can get groceries, feed myself, but not think much further than this. And it reminds me of those times running around San Francisco and New York, exploring neighborhoods, and getting some hot food to survive, then huddling into a library or cafe. I didn't think much beyond my bodily needs. I mean, I had many urban planning thoughts, but not cultural, societal, mind, love. They were cold, urban thoughts.**
.
**Living in Taiwan is the opposite. It's warm. I can think all day and night, far, deep, into the mind, of other people, in time and space. I can think of everything, whilst living in the present, scootering around, or walking around the city. I am able to think, not just survive.**

Another thought from today, or perhaps yesterday:
**Architects destroy the world. They design for others. People naturally design for themselves. No need to design, implement, put material together: people do it normally.** The best thing that dot architects made is the place that they work in, because it was naturally created over time, annexing as needed. Perhaps their homes are also good works, better than their portfolio.

There was a daydream of explaining to Sweta how hip-hop affected the males of our generation, as a response of her telling me Swimming Pools is a good dance song. I don't think it's worth detailing.

—

from a sticky note:
[todo: to blog]
> self vs people?
>  - **self**, fuck people / culture, do work, believe nothing else, fuck communication

It seems somewhat recently, I changed my decision-making apparatus to be more selfish. Out of survival? Comfort? Nah. Out of tiredness of stupidity of people and their cultures. Being political, educating, being critical, living by those ideals is defeating, and in a culture such as Taiwan, seemingly impossible. Thus, I must revert to my former, independent self, doing things on my own, without friends.

It’s great to travel with Taiwanese people, traveling cheaply, talking, eating snacks, taking trips in semi-natural places such as the mountain or beach, but it seems impossible to work toward education, art, or even essential sectors such as health. And in desiring to work, I’ve lost interest in the people, because they don’t desire to work. They only desire to live. Barely. As I did, near-homelessly.

Thus, it’s best to work in the West, live in the East.

[todo: can continue thought]

Crazy! It’s night time and I still feel fuckin’ great! Caffeine? Orrrrr that tiny bit of exercise I did last night? And the morning hot bath. Yeah, I think those are the top two factors. And generally just staying indoors, at least during the day. So perhaps the weather too is a big factor? Not so sure. But I haven’t exercised for so long, that I’m thinking it was that, and just eating more, real food, not just instant noodles.
—


Ahhh another great day. I slept poorly, so how did I wake up feeling so well? Hot bath? Caffeine? Scooter ride? People nearby in library? Light in the library? All of it.
—


a note from perhaps yesterday, or the day before when I tried to watch Into the Forest of Fireflies Light  in a rather sense-deprived library: [blogged, the website has edited text]
keep traveling, keep living, keep reality in view.
Too boring, seen already.
  - And that’s the truth. There’s no desire of re-experiencing something I’ve recently experienced, except perhaps as some sort of further philosophical investigation. I wanted to continue living. I wanted nature. I wanted the elements to affect me, the stimuli of reality, not information, not in a sense-deprived environment such as a room, office, school, or suburban house. People shouldn’t have to use media to make-up for the lack of stimuli, such as turning on foreign music or artificial ambient noise in a cafe, or other comfortable environment. Let the environment be the stimulus, let reality be that environment, then route attention to whatever one desires. Do not go to a closed environment (ex. library, room in a house, etc.) to study, just live, outside, and take the book along, having the contents in one’s peripheral attention, and reality in one’s main attention.
  - Furthermore, such senseless environments lead to depression. Without stimulus, the body desires comfort (in temperature, diet) and sleeps without desire to live because there is nothing to respond to.
  - Even more so, the habit of going to, commuting to, or living in such environment creates a very mis-represented vision (imagined) of reality.
  - Thus, another argument for nomadism?

Not sure how I got here, but:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism
Neurotic extraverts, for example, would experience high levels of both positive and negative emotional states, a kind of "emotional roller coaster". Individuals who score low on neuroticism (particularly those who are also high on extraversion) generally report more happiness and satisfaction with their lives.

Research has found that a wide range of clinical mental disorders are associated with elevated levels of neuroticism compared to levels in the general population.[4][18][19] Disorders associated with elevated neuroticism include mood disorders, such as depression and bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, dissociative identity disorder, and hypochondriasis. Personality disorders as listed in DSM-IV in general tend to be associated with elevated neuroticism.

Neuroticism appears to be related to physiological differences in the brain. Hans Eysenck theorized that neuroticism is a function of activity in the limbic system, and his research suggests that people who score highly on measures of neuroticism have a more reactive sympathetic nervous system, and are more sensitive to environmental stimulation.[21] Behavioral genetics researchers have found that a significant portion of the variability on measures of neuroticism can be attributed to genetic factors.

This study found that in 49 of the 55 nations studied, women scored higher in neuroticism than men. In no country did men report significantly higher neuroticism than women.

Neuroticism, along with other personality traits, has been mapped across states in the United States. People in eastern states such as New York, New Jersey, West Virginia, and Mississippi tend to score high on neuroticism, whereas people in many western states, such as Utah, Colorado, South Dakota, Oregon, and Arizona score lower on average. People in states that are higher in neuroticism also tend to have higher rates of heart disease and lower life expectancy.

One of the theories regarding evolutionary approaches to depression focuses on neuroticism. A moderate amount of neuroticism may provide benefits, such as increased drive and productivity, due to greater sensitivity to negative outcomes. Too much, however, may reduce fitness by producing, for example, recurring depressions. Thus, evolution will select for an optimal amount and most people will have neuroticism near this optimum. However, because neuroticism likely has a normal distribution in the population, a minority will be highly neurotic.

Woke up to the wonderful cloudy weather. Just one family picnicking near me. Perfect. In the physically slow, tea-drinking, listening, not-thinking, working mode when I woke up at 12pm or so.

Transcribed a bunch of physical papers to digital notes. See thoughts from papers.txt.


2/10/2016
Didn’t do much today. Just slept in, or felt like I slept in, but must have woke up at around 10am, refreshed. Turns out sleeping on my side is the only way I can get the fully-refreshed wake up feeling, and, it must be from sunlight waking me up, or, perhaps sleeping in a warm place.

Finally got money, so I bought some more instant noodles, tea, and coffee candy (that’s a new dry good idea). I also had the good milk tea for breakfast, mmmm. And peanut butter toast for lunch, mmmmmmm. And a stolen apple pear, mmmmmmmmm!

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiribati#Demographics
  - found this bit on Wikipedia, usual of development problems resulting in health problems
Health[edit]
The population of Kiribati has a life expectancy at birth of 60 years (57 for males, and 63 for females) and an infant mortality rate of 54 deaths per 1,000 live births.[10] Tuberculosis has a small presence in the country, with 365 cases of 100,000 a year.[82] Government expenditure on health was at US$268 per capita (PPP) in 2006.[83] In 1990–2007, there were 23 physicians per 100,000 persons.[84] Since the arrival of Cuban doctors, the infant mortality rate has decreased significantly.[85]

Most health problems are related to consumption of semi-raw seafood, limited amount of food storage facilities, and bacterial contamination of fresh water supplies. In the early 2000s, between 1 and 7% of the population, depending on the island, were annually treated for food poisoning in a hospital. Modernization and cross-cultural exchange of the late 20th century brought new issues of unhealthy diet and lifestyle; heavy smoking, especially among the young population; and external infections, including HIV/AIDS.[86]

Kiribati is the country with the third highest prevalence of smoking, with 54% of the population reported as smokers.[87]

Fresh water remains a concern of Kiribati – during the dry season (Aumaiaki), water has been drilled for instead of using rain water tanks. In recent years, there has been a longer than usual Aumaikai season resulting in additional water having to be drilled from beneath the water table. This has introduced water-borne illnesses, compounding the health problems within Kiribati.[88]

Dreamt again of returning home at EMT. Emergency for Vijay Uncle. Went with Dad to see problem. CPR to re-starting heart device.

28/9/2016
[todo: many of these require further thoughts / blogging]
Some thoughts of the day or past few days, which I tried to recollect:
  - Dreamt of EMT at home. Neil’s hotel on fire. Performed well with many Indians there to help.

  - My twitter consists of NY  indie game devs, and it’s still culturally narrow. All about media / election. Only Nathias from MIT is okay. And even then, still narrow, with educational talks and books and media. It’s all a waste of time. All communication. Narrow. Need reality.

  - Being poor causes me to be in one place because I cannot move. Or, at least, I feel that I cannot. And then get into a sedentary habit of using digital devices. Then I socially die. But the reality is, I can! I can always hitch! Now I know.

  - Critical theory / social development is still most desired / most motivated to do.

  - Consuming art objects others created strangely requires much mental power

  - Capitalism as narrowing of action / decision-making. EMT vs creative work (larger works, unseen, benefits all of society, volunteer / charitable — just need to crowdsource for verification)

  - Become old independent self, don’t car about what others care about. Make things myself, don’t educate others; or design, or develop? DIY?

  - Recently thinking like a simpleton, no creative endeavors. Human philosophy, how societies (and their materials) came to be, that kind of philosophy opposes current work, attention diverts.
    - But perhaps that kind of philosophy requires me to physically wander around the world. To see how everything came to be. It’s a different kind of work. It’s all encompassing. Broader. The big picture. Big ideas. It feels much better, less constricted. To travel around societies and think on the outskirts of dense settlements.

  - **Desire out of local creativity / consumption** — moving hostel idea, herbal drinks idea, bamboo fishing rods idea, urban / social development VS **what society needs** — survival, industrial capitalism, higher [?], **what society wants** and therefore is willing to pay — English, consumerism (commodity [food, drink, entertainment]), etc.
    - [this was blogged into Creativity vs What Society Needs and Wants]

from sticky notes from the past month or so:

a note:
need Western life
  - choose time / money for training, desire apartment
  - vs experience, hitch, indie work
-

another note:
need to go with people. That’s why hostels are great. They are social, yet multi-directional, depending on the people in it. Other living situations, social directions are more limited because there are less people, and the same.
…
It requires independence, which is okay. Yet, it’s still better to talk to hostel mates, as the mind is border.

thought on Asia vs American travel / tourism
  - [perhaps thought while on the mountain in Kending where Chinese tourists came to?]
-

another note:
thought: material commodity + international market via internet marketplaces
food -> restaurant / bar?
local market 
  - sea jewelry, clothing, etc.
social
  - fishing, snorkeling, tour/culture, natural (plant, animal)

  - 6. How many days have you now spent canoeing in the Amazon and how do you survive?

    By now it must be close to 300 days on the river. Paddling days, mind you. Not including rest days. I survive mostly by fishing and will shoot the occasional junglefowl or paca to supplement that. I also bring rice and farinha, along with other dry goods.
…
8. What are your thoughts on Pirannahs

I think piranhas are delicious. They’re meaty, abundant, and a mouth-watering delight when fried. They’re a schooling species and so you can catch large numbers of them easily with nets. I see them as toothy little Happy Meals.
…
11. How do you support yourself financially? Have you gotten much work in South America?

Oh, I learned the ways of the road from the street hippies down here. Anyone who has travelled here knows the type. I can twist names out of wire and mend earrings and weave bracelets. I do that on the road, mostly for booze money. I’m also fluent in Portuguese and can hold my own in Spanish. Sometimes I’m a fishing guide. I translate people’s websites. I make and sell cocktails in backpacker towns. And then there’s those times when I just haul sacks of cement up stairways or unload semi truck trailers or scrub the toilets in restaurants. You can always find something to do – if you lower your standards enough.
—

Holy moly, reading other backpack stories is inspirational. It’s possible to hitch around the world! Awesome. But 300 days of canoeing? :O

https://hitchtheworld.com/
https://hitchtheworld.com/hitchhiking-tips/part-four-finding-food/
The uncooked dry food products I usually have somewhere in my pack are pasta, beans, and rice.
…
If you know how to make trinkets or sell things while on the road, you can always trade for food.

Sometimes you will just have to go hungry. Remember, the human body can go more than a month without food; pride yourself on your ability to take hunger, on your ability to live life like a true adventurer and not a pansy nine-to-fiver who gets all cranky when he misses lunch.

https://hitchtheworld.com/hitchhiking-tips/part-ten-hitchhiking-gear/
  - b) Shoes: A good pair of footwear is probably the most essential part of your gear. I personally reccomend a sturdy pair of boots; not cowboy boots, but lace-up military or hiking boots. These are waterproof, have good arch and ankle support, and will never let you down on a long walk. Additionally, in a hot climate, if you have lace-up military boots, you can tuck your pants into your boots to prevent disease-carrying mosquitoes and other biting insects from getting at your legs. In a cold climate with snow, your feet and pant legs will stay warm and dry.

  - In the tropics, a hammock with a mosquito netting is extremely useful and very valuable to your comfort.

  - Shelter: Many people carry tents, and these are indeed useful.  I carry a tent for cold or rainy climates, but a tarp and hammock in the tropics.

  - f) First Aid Kit: Your health is important; do not skimp on your first aid kit.

  - U.S. Army Survival Manual*
  - Field Guide to Edible Plants*

  - Part Six: Getting Extra Cash
You can also pick up odd jobs, be it for an afternoon or for a week, to get a little extra dough for necessary things. They are usually very easy to find. Try farms or places that hire day workers.

If you are skilled with your hands, you can make trinkets or little things to sell on the street. I have recently started selling water-colour paintings and make things out of old telephone cable wire.

1. 
  - *eye contact!*
  - Signs definitely help a lot, so carry a permanent marker with you at all times and be on the lookout for pieces of cardboard that can be used to make a good sign.
  - …or you can use disgarded junk found lying around, such as this old construction reflector I found in northern Chile. I would wave it around like TSA at the airport.
  - I rarely start my hitchhiking wait off with a sign, unless I know I am in a slow area. If nobody picks me up for the first hour or two, I usually find some cardboard to make a sign. Sometimes, if there´s no cardboard readily avalible, I write something in the inside of my left forearm.
  - If you are stuck in a high-traffic area, my advice to you is: just start walking. Eventually you’ll get to a more remote area, or perhaps people will think that since you are walking you aren’t going very far, and you may get a series of short rides to a better spot.

2.
  - Most everyone who picks up hitchhikers is very friendly, and it can be read on their face. However, some people just give you a Bad Vibe, and I don’t recommend getting in with a Bad Vibe person. In my entire life, out of thousands and thousands of rides, I’ve only had one Bad Vibe person. But it happens, and when it does, you’ll know it.
  - Once you get in, be as polite as possible. Ask their name, give them yours, and shake hands or perform whatever is the customary greeting in the area you are travelling. Tell them where you are going, why, the whole story. Most people pick up hitchhikers for the company, so make some small talk. If they don`t seem like the talkative type, then you can always read your book or stare blankly out the window and enjoy the scenery.
    - Note: sometimes it gets old telling the same story eight million times per day. If you want to invent a little we understand. For example, I once was a pimp in Vegas. For all that trucker in Peru knows.
  - Sometimes, where you are dropped off can be the most dangerous part about hitchhiking. If you’re wandering around in the bad part of town with a big pack, no matter how dirty, you will attract attention. This is why it’s important you negociate a good place to be dropped off. If you must get off in a downtown area, try and negociate to be left in the nice area of town, and figure out where the local police station is.

3. night
  - Hitchhiking at night is undoubtably more dangerous than during the day, but if you are in a rural area than it’s probably fine….danger-wise. Be sure to stand in well-lighted areas, and try not to act too drunk, you cretin.
  - Your most successful night hitchhiking will probably be at all-night truck stops or gas stations, which is convienent since if you get tired of trying you can just crash out back and in the morning you’ll still be in a decent hitchhiking spot.

4. food
  - Weather you’re traveling on a budget or with nothing at all, food is always a must-have. Usually the cheapest food is normal loaves of bread from local bakeries, which cost anywhere from 5 to 50 cents a loaf, depending on the country.
  - ‘Will Work For Food’ has been around since people started using money. Go into a resturaunt and ask if you can wash a few dishes or mop the floor in exchange for some bread. You will almost never be turned down, and sometimes they won’t even let you work, but will still give you a meal. Afterwards, offer again to work, even if you know they will refuse.
  - Sometimes your ride will offer to buy you a meal, and it’s okay to accept.
  - Dumpster-diving is always an option
  - Forging is also an option. Make sure you can identlfy edible plants from non-edible ones. DO NOT eat any type of plant that you are not absolutely sure is edible. If you are unsure of it’s edibility, apply the Universal Edibility Test.
  - Also, don´t forget the viability of obtaining uncooked dry food products.
  - The uncooked dry food products I usually have somewhere in my pack are pasta, beans, and rice.
  - You may prefer to carry a camping stove with you. This is very convienent and will make you feel independent. Or you can simply build a campfire.
    - The downsides of camping stoves are the extra weight they add to your gear and the need to refill the gas bottle.
  - If you have no camping stove, you can still utilize uncooked dry food products. To cook, ask around in resturaunts until you find a nice owner who will cook the food for you. Oftentimes they will add meat or other extra goodies, and most of the time they let you sit inside and eat at the table like a real customer!
  - If you know how to make trinkets or sell things while on the road, you can always trade for food.
  - Sometimes you will just have to go hungry. Remember, the human body can go more than a month without food; pride yourself on your ability to take hunger, on your ability to live life like a true adventurer and not a pansy nine-to-fiver who gets all cranky when he misses lunch.
    - lol

5. places to sleep
  - I usually use a technique known as ‘covert camping,’ (spending the night in some concealed place such as the bushes along the side of the highway, showers in an all-night gas station, or a drainage ditch).
    - yep
  - …or just find a friendly local homeless person, who is usually happy to show you his bridge. If your in the country, cow pastures or forests work best. Wake up with the sun.
    - <3
  - Bus stations in Latin America
  - Public servants will sometimes help you out. I’ve had the most luck at fire stations and police stations.
  - You can also just make friends. Talk to people, nice, family people. If you’re lucky they’ll let you crash on their couch and give you a hot meal.
    - :)
  - If you’re in a city and don’t want to try any of the above options, go to a place away from the city to make camp. Try to find somewhere high up of otherwise concealed.
    - beautiful
  - When you’re riding with you’re ride, speak serenely about the hospitality and kindless of all the strangers you’ve met on your trip. Then don’t say anything for awhile and let the sound of the road take over. This can lead to a bed, breakfast, and a ride back to the highway.
    - lolol
  - Stealthy hammock-squatting in a patrtally constructed building in Palmas, Tocantins! (Three nights and was never caught!)
    - oh snap
  - I adore hammocks. Sleeping in them while vagabonding is perhaps the best way to spend a night – providing the weather is co-operative and it is not too cold. A hammock can be set up practically anywhere where there´s a couple of properly spaced trees, pillars, or any sort of sturdy, vertical object, and the hammock-bandit need not worry about things on the ground such as sticks, rocks, thorns, thick underbrush, and unpleasent ground-dwelling insects.
    - todo: need to buy a hammock?
  - To hang my hammock I use an easy, quick-release knot called the Siberian hitch, both to join the rope with the tree and the hammock with the rope. I also usually add six or seven half hitches over the hitch closest to the hammock to reduce the risk of slippage.
  - Rain presents a problem – or more specifically, storms. You´ll need a tarp, extra rope, and the platitude to spend a rough night getting blown around and dampened. I use the same knots to hang the tarp that I use for the hammock
    - todo: maybe a tarp too.
  - Bugs are also a problem – a mosquito netting in worth it´s weight in gold and possession of one will garuntee you vastly fewer sleepless nights and dramatically reduce your risk of contracting mosquito-borne illnesses. Hang it from the same rope as your tarp.
    - absolutely need a mosquito net

7. public transport
  - Personally, I hate public transportation – especially taxis; however, sometimes they can be useful for getting out of a large city…and yes, sometimes they will give you free rides.
    - interesting! Ask a bus for a free ride!

  - Taking the bus in the evening is not preferable, simply because the bus driver probably won’t offer you a place to stay for the night. A hitched ride might.
    - neat point!

  - In cities, if there is a subway system it is usually better than the city bus system, which can be extremely confusing.
  - true, but sometimes more expensive. Marginally.

8. free check-ups?
  - It is important to maintain good health while travelling. Many hospitals offer free check-ups, so take advantage of this when you can. Also, be sure you vaccinations are up-to-date if traveling to the tropics or th¡rd-world countries. Vaccinations are usually free, though sometimes you may have to pay a small amount.

  - If you become very sick while traveling and are unable to afford your medications or a hospital stay, most countries have aid programs that can help you. Don’t put off getting the necessary medications just because you think you can ‘tough it out.’ While this may sometimes be the case, it’s still not worth the risk of dying over.

9. hitching in bad weather
  - If it is raining, have clean, dry socks on hand.
    - interesting note, keeping feet dry
  …If it’s snowing, make sure you’re well-insulated and have dry clothes avalible to you.
  - If you have a tarp, you can try and use this to keep yourself relatively dry.
    - lol
  - If you find yourself not in desperate need of a ride when the weather breaks, try to utilise this time to dry your equipment, if the situation allows for it. Hang wet socks or gloves from tree branches.
    - importance of drying clothes, gloves, hat, etc. Especially in rainy, snowy weather
  - At the end of the day, try to find a place to dry your gear, such as the inside of a gas station near the heater.

10. hitchhiking gear
  - a) Clothing: Be sure you take weather-appropriate clothing. A few t-shirts are always a must, as are good socks,
    - again socks is italicized, and I agree with t-shirts
  -  Sometimes, a scarf is essential in any type of weather, because it can double as a bandana in windy or dusty areas. Also, a good pair of gloves is ESSENTIAL if the area you are hitchhiking in is cold.
    - understands utility of a scarf
  - b) Shoes: A good pair of footwear is probably the most essential part of your gear. I personally reccomend a sturdy pair of boots; not cowboy boots, but lace-up military or hiking boots. These are waterproof, have good arch and ankle support, and will never let you down on a long walk. 
    - very interesting. todo: buy them!
      - https://www.amazon.com/Danner-Mens-USMC-8-Inch-GORE-TEX/dp/B00GLU201A/ref=pd_sbs_309_4?ie=UTF8&refRID=CSNDGYEK3Z23BRXDRN1Z
        - something like this? $350!?!?
    - http://www.ncosupport.com/military-news/unauthorized-army-combat-boots.html
      - COTS boots, for army authorized?
    - just ask Taiwanese people for an army store

  - If you have too many things to fit in the main space and your pack is equipped with crossstraps, you might try using a counterweight bag. Counterweight bags can be anything, from plastic grocery bags to cloth bags, even tents. Clip this into your crossstraps; it can help counterbalance the weight of your pack. I usually keep food and other dispensible goods in my counterweight bag.
    - neat!

  - e) Shelter: Many people carry tents, and these are indeed useful.  I carry a tent for cold or rainy climates, but a tarp and hammock in the tropics.
    - change shelter according to weather

funny hitchhiking signs:
 - Carrying a destination sign when hitchhiking is a lot like going to college. Even though deep down inside it may not mean a thing, it’s a convenient way of explaining to people what you’re up to.
  –Ken Hicks, The Complete Hitchhiker

about-canoeing-in-the-amazon-basin:
Now, how did I manage to get my hands on this wooden adventure machine? I had no money when I got to Aveiro. The answer is quite simple. I traded my laptop computer for it, and I also worked hauling buckets of wet cement around to build a second story on some guys house.
  - lolol. Wow. Got rid of the laptop!

Hence, no more posts. I made a few halfhearted attempts as far as Parintins, but I never had enough money for Internet cafes. And so, HitchTheWorld died for awhile. But now, thanks to a new vigor and drive, and the realization that if I don’t keep writing this shit down nobody will ever believe me, it’s come back to life.
  - lolol

Fish. Camp. Hunt. Eat. Drink. Sleep. Paddle, paddle paddle paddle. This is my current lifestyle. Enjoy the old writings about hitchhiking. Those were the days, to be sure. But for the next few years, the word “hitchhiking” will be used sparingly.

Instead, have paddling.
  - hmmm. It seems he changed from hitchhiking, being with people, to complete isolated travels, survivalist. What’s the fun in that? Media? Books?

24/9/2016 (reading continued):
SORRY FOR DOING THAT IN YOUR CAR..:
  - 2012 Edit: I haven’t worn underwear since 2010
    - lolol
  - [todo: I didn’t read the second half]

BIG RIGS & MORE BORDERS:
  - oops, this was a previous post
So I did, and he sent me the US$20, which took three days to get there (I obviously had to pay for those three days as well). During those three days I had absolutely no food whatever, so I pinched old pizza slices and milk from the fridge, rubbing a few people the wrong way. At least I gave the people who’s food I had been stealing $5 before I left. After paying as well for the four days in the hostal, I once again had no money left.
  - hostels are terrible. Can get stuck owing money. Better to sleep outside, where one can always continue to hitch without problems. No need to rely on scooters, hostels, or anything to slow one down.

ROUGH SEAS, RAINFOREST, AND BEING MAROONED: CROSSING THE DARIÈN GAP
  - I left the hotel and began the short twenty minute walk to downtown Panama City. I figured that I would find a hostel there somewhere. (EDIT SEPT 2011: to work) I looked for about an hour and a half, until I finally gave up and spent some of my last bits of money on Internet so I could look up the addresses.
  - looks for work for only an hour and a half. Awesome.

I was turned down once more at Luna’s Castel. The owner was a pompus prick. While I was there asking him questions about crossing the Darièn Gap, he was being very rude to one of his employees, telling her, “Why can’t you do anything right?”
  - :), so pure-hearted Patrick is.

  - Patrick spends much time looking for hostel work, not just an hour and a half, but an entire day, 4 hours to find one hostel.

  - I tried on at least ten different people the “I’m looking for a safe place to camp when there is no safe place to camp” trick, but to no avail. Also, I was starving, not having eaten since my free continental breakfast at the hotel that morning.
    - hehehe, no help in the cities, or safe places to camp. :(

  - I was awoken at five a.m. the next morning by some guy washing his car in the parking lot next to the park. I named him Sir Wash-A-Lot, since he washed his car for close to two hours.

    I got up after people started arriving in the park to walk their dogs, and I didn’t want to look like a homeless person. So I packed up my roll, and started walking.
    - heheheh, so true

  - I was lucky in the morning. I had 25 cents on me, and I went to try to buy some food that costs 75 cents with it. The lady was super nice and just charged me the quarter, and gave me free coffee!
    - lolol, awesome

  - So I had to walk through the city. I finally started to get out of the downtown after about two hours, when the skyline changed from mostly-unfinished condominiums to old church ruins.
    - hehehe, the writing doesn’t mention much about the environment. Really need film to see the details. Yet, with writing, you can see the person’s attention.

  - So after he dropped me off, I continued wandering south, at this point totally baked. I even forgot to stick my thumb out for a good fifteen minutes.
    - hahahahahahhahaha lololol

  - As soon as I got there, I took a much needed shower. However, I noticed that in his bathroom, he had posters of…well…men. Naked. And flexing.

    Okay, so he was gay. No problem. Just stay away from my bum, and we’ll have no problems whatsoever. And we didn’t, except for when he wanted me to sleep in the same bed as him, and I politely suggested the couch instead.
    - ohhhh snap. Maybe Patrick can come off as gay too, but isn’t.

  - “That’s the road to San Blas,” Eric told me. “It’s about forty kilometers. Here’s a gallon of water,” he handed me a jug, “and good luck to you.”
    - holy moly
    - oh, never mind, he’s able to hitch on it

  - We passed the border into the park, and I was charged six of my nine dollars for entry. Good thing I had that…
    - lol, to have money is fortunate, but to not have is nothing to worry about.

  - So after unloading all the stuff (there was quite a lot) the pilots of the boat agreed to take me to the islands for free, since I was being so helpful. The tiny boat, overloaded with supplies, lumbered slowly off into the sea.
    - by helping locals, can usually get by for free. Just work exchange, really.

  - There were many sailboats from around the world anchored all around the island. So, not knowing what else to do, I changed into my swimsuit and swam out to them.
    - lol, awesome

  - I went up to each boat and asked them if they were sailing south. None of them were, and I was swimming around for close to three hours, even going out to an American vessel that was anchored close to a quarter mile from shore.
  - I asked Canadian, Austrian, German, Dutch, American, and Australian boats, and even swam the half a mile to the next island over and asked those boats. No luck. So I paddled on back to my island and took a much-needed break.
   - wow. Good swimmer.

  - I rehydrated by enjoying several beverages provided by the local trees, until a wrinkeled old lady came out to me and told me to stop drinking all of her coconuts (no tomar mis pipas!)
    - lolol

  - The Austrian guy bought me a beer and told me stories of modern-day pirates, which include tales of the notorious Redbeard of the Carribean, (he kills everyone aboard, takes the money and/or gold, and sinks the ship) and how exactly those Somolian pirates got .50 caliber machine guns for their little speedboats (the Chinese, of course.)
    - so, he does get some reality in there, through stories! But still, it’s naive, much like Peter.

  - I went to bed in a little hut on the beach graciously provided by the local law enforcement, and slept well.
    - sometimes the police can help find a place to sleep
  - I was awaken abruptly the next morning by the police capitan, who told me to hurry up and get my stuff, he’s found me a boat!
    - and a boat!

  - To my right was the thick, untamed jungles of the Darièn Gap, looking more mythical and omnious than ever. Coconut trees dotted the shoreline, fading quickly into impenetrable virgin rainforest. The Gap is truly one of the last great frontiers of our world, and I know in my heart that my life will not be complete until I risk everything and venture across.
    - mmmmmm.

  - Finally after about four hours of this, we stopped in Puerto Obaldìa to get our passports stamped. Mine was totally soaked, and the immigration guy looked at it disagreeably as he searched for a place to stamp my exit visa.
    - lolol

  - I walked nearly two hours into the lush rainforest, far away from any human habituation. This was the real, hardcore, jaguar-filled jungle, my friends, and I was pretty much in heaven. I found a small clearling that seemed like it would be a good place to pass the night. Just as soon as I set down my pack, I saw a flash of movement to my left. I investigated farther, and to my immense delight, saw my very first poison dart frog in the wild! He was very small, only about the size of a quarter, and was black with small, brilliant green spots. I poked him gently with a leaf, and he chirped indignantly and dissapered into the leaf litter.
    - :)

  - By this time I was dry. I dressed and hiked back to camp, arriving just as night was falling. I fell asleep listening to chirping frogs, buzzing insects, and the faint flutter of bat wings…basically the sounds of the rainforest that I had been dreaming about since I was five and I learned that all the coolest snakes in the world lived in the jungle. I had sweet dreams.
    - :) :)

  - The townsfolk were all very nice and fed me some much-needed food, which was great of them since I hadn’t eaten a proper meal in nearly three days.
    - wah

  - Towords the evening, the local immigration place got wind that I didn’t have any money. I had visited them the day before to get my entry visa, and they just assumed I had some cash. They brought me in, and threatened to send me back to Panamà, since I had a tourist visa, and that ment I needed to have money with me. They eventually didn’t deport me, but told me to pass Colombia as fast as I could, and that if I didn’t find a boat to Turbo tomorrow that they would send me back to Panamà.
    - holy moly

  - Now I really, really needed a boat. When I woke up this morning, I found a small passenger boat that fortunately agreed to take me to Turbo. I waved goodbye to my generous Colombian friends, and sped off into the sunrise.
    - wah

  - I got off, thanked the pilots,and pushed past the taxi peddlers. I began my walk out of town, and soon I was back on the good ole Pan American Highway, headed south to Medellìn!
    - this is what one must do. Have a direction and go. The road is the home. The cities are filthy, capitalistic. Just hitch on and find simple jobs with lovely people in lovely places.

AMAZING PEOPLE & THE ANDES MOUNTAINS:
  - ah yes, these are turning out to be good chapters now, like a book.
  - his posts are within days of each other, so it’s all going by so fast. First experiences. First thoughts.
  - I love Colombia!
    - haha, seems like another good country with people in solidarity, and nature!

  - So, since I was pretty much fucking rich, I bought a metro ticket for about $2,000 and rode on the train for about half an hour. After getting off, I realized I was still in Medellìn, so I grabbed a bus for about fifty cents and rode it as far as it would take me, which was about half an hour. I jumped off, thanked the driver, and started walking again.
    - hahahah, fucking rich

  - After leaving that cool little group, I just walked for about ten kilometers, enjoying the fresh air and a beautiful, scenic sunset over the heavily forested northen Andes. Not for the first time, especially since making it across the Gap and into South America, I felt a tremendous sense of accomplishment come over me (which is a euphanisism for feeling pretty damn good about myself,) and at that moment I don’t think I ever loved my life more.
    - :)

  - I walked until about eight o’clock in the night (oddly enough, I felt totally safe…almost like home) until I came to a small town nestled cozily onto the mountianside.
    - :)

   …I was planning on just camping for the night, but every single bit of land that wasn’t the road was at an inconvienent eighty-five degree angle.
    - lolol

  - After that, I took a much-needed shower, as I hadn’t yet had one on this continent.
    - ahhh, so he is skipping on showers. Rough.

  - I opened my eyes, laughed, and told them pleasantly, “¡Buenos dìas!”
    - ahhh, just being optimistic, happy, not minding of others. That’s the key. I was the same way, and it reciprocated so well on so many occasions. That’s why I did so well in Taiwan at first. I was happy-go-lucky, interested in culture and nature and, well, everything. Non-political. No direction, really. And that resulted in great experiences, happy times.

  - They were pretty cool dudes. They even gave me some water and bushel of ripe plantain bananas. I’ve decided that I absolutely LOVE plantains…there a lot smaller than a regular banana, are much sweeter, and have a much better flavour. I ate about twenty, much to the amusement of my heavily armed friends, who were convinced I would have the shits later.
    - fooooood. :) :)

  - I got a ride after about half an hour of chilling with my policìa friends to the city of Pereira, thanks to a guy named Alfonso. I’m ninty percent sure he was gay, though he claimed to have a wife and two kids. If he was, this wouldn’t be the first time a gay dude has picked me up…in fact, it happens quite often. They’re always really nice, and buy me lots of food.
    - agreed and also continuing in optimism. :)

  - I got another hotel for tonight, this one with facilities for washing clothes! This is a good thing because by now they are radioactively dirty. A hotel two nights in a row…Colombia is spoiling me…
    - lolol

  - I had a great night at my hotel. I didn’t get to sleep until very late (for reasons I won’t go into…haha) and I awoke late the next morning around ten thirty.
    - wow, so maybe he’s not entirely pure. But that’s okay, hah.

  - I decided to go on the rural route, even though it’s a bit longer, since it was only a few hours from dark and Cali is one of the most dangerous cities in South America.
    - always choose countryside for camping. Also, must start much earlier for hitchhiking, because the days ends at 6!

  - The owner noticed how hot and tired I looked, and noted the fact that I was drinking tap water since I didn’t have any money for the bottled kind (that money burned a hole in my pocket faster than a lit cigarette.)
    - lololol, can’t save money

  - After my Internet time, I walked down the road a bit to find a place to camp. It was very dark, so this proved difficult.
    - mmm, no flashlight

  …finally settled on a space between the seemingly endless rows of sugarcane fields, partially conceled behind a tree on the side of the road. I rolled out my bedroll and tried to go to sleep.
    - :) farms. But mosquitos?

  …It was then that the mosquitos found me. Not just one or two, but hundreds were swarming all around me, a giant cloud of bloodsucking evil making that incessant bzzzzzzzzz. Fianlly, after an hour of laying there and basically giving blood, I couldn’t take it anymore. I raced out of the field, the sharp leaves of the sugarcane tearing little cuts all over my arms and neck. I burst out onto the road and ran back into the town, still able to hear the dreaded cloud following me down the street.
    - lolol, yep

  - I went to the same place that I got food at earlier, called Parador Alaska, and bought a pastry with the last of my cash. This was to be my breakfast money the next morning, but I wanted something to chew on to distract from all the itching. I picked out the most tasty-looking doughnut I could find. The thing about doughnuts is that they’re never as good as they look in the window. Sometimes they’re too dry, or lacking the cream filling you expected. This time was no exception; I picked out a strawberry coated monster, and after one bite immedietly wished I’d stuck to the good old-faithful glazed.
    - lol, even details for food choosing

  - It’s funny…I came to South America hoping to find new and exciting things to bite and sting me. Instead, I find mosquitoes and fire ants, the same things that have been biting and stinging me for the past twenty years.
    - haha

  - I went to the police station, and told them I was looking for a good place to camp…my trick worked, and I was allowed to sleep in their yard, where there were considerably fewer mosquitoes.
    - hahaha, yep.

  - These dudes dropped me off here…it’s such a small town it’snot even on Google maps…clearly one of those towns that is just here because of the road.
    - hehe, urban development / human geography?

  - She had a geography workbook that was clearly designed for third graders, and, bless her heart, was trying her damndest to learn it all. Good for her. I told her everything I knew, and was rewarded with a Coke and some dry but tasty bread for my troubles. A Three-Meal Day…it’s not often I get one of those.
    - amazing. Just pure optimism, reciprocates so well.

  - I was waiting at a another police checkpoint just outside of “town,” and the cops were kind enough to let me use their computer. I love the law enforcement in Colombia. Good blokes, the lot of them. It shouldn’t be hard to find a place to sleep tonight, as I’m more or less in the middle of nowhere.
    - hehehe, good ol’ cops.

  - I was turned down by the hostel…no suprise there. I’ve figured out that most hostel owners see backbackers like me as a dime a dozen, and aren’t usually too keen to help out.
    - mmmm. Hostel owners find it a trouble for single-day workers, and desire long-term. Money-whores.

  - I found the place; it was medium-sized, and consisted of the actual residential, a small resturaunt, and a convience store. I asked the Señora and she told me that I could stay and work for as long as I pleased. Nice…
    - wow, found work in the same day, and can stay as long as he liked! Awesome. Can always work exchange.

  - There was Daisy, who gave me all the work I needed, and Dylan, a twelve year old who served as a waiter. We got along great, me and Dylan, and I showed him all of my outdoor survival techniques from the U.S. Army Survival Manual.
    - hahaha, always the kids. Lovely. :)

  - I stayed here for five days, doing odd jobs that were mostly washing dishes and chopping more fruit
    - so, given the opportunity, he will stay, given the people are good, and the work simple.

  - I managed to get a few taxi cabs to give me free rides, and I made it to the outskirts. One taxi guy was really cool, and took me to his home and gave me soup, much to the delight of his entire family. One small girl of about one year of age apparently wanted soup, too, and showed that she did by gnawing on my leg with her two tiny teeth.
    - hahahah, he loves animals, and kids.

  - EDIT SEPT 2011: Working at the hotel was a great experience for me, as it opened up a new road-survival trick for me: work for food. I wouldn’t figure out how to use it properly for another few months, but at least the idea had been planted. It felt truly wonderful to have earned my victuals for once.
    - hahaha, realizes much later

VOLCANOES, GO-CARTS, & CANADIANS:
  - I was very glad to get out of Quito, as it seemed very exhust-choked and I was not feeling to well after leaving.
    - mmm, my feeing in cities, especially Taipei.

  - Finally, I got so frustrated with all the taxis stopping that I made a sign that said “¡NO TAXI! ¡NO TENGO PLATA!” I got a ride within minutes. 
    - lolol.

  - I guess altitude doesn’t discriminate against latitude.
    - first piece of good writing.

  - I was actually feeling a bit under the weather at this point, and decided to find a nice place to take an afternoon nap, since it was but one o’clock. I found a place near a small stream than went through a cow pasture. There was an old swimming pool nearby that hadn’t seen any action since the forties or earlier, and Mother Nature had fully reclaimed it. I made a nice camp there and slept.
    - mmm, able to nap at 1pm, and camp quickly.

  - When I awoke, it was nearly dark, so I decided that I would just stay the night here. I went back up into the town to get something to drink and a cigarette. I stopped at a restaurant for a bit of water, and the owner was awesome! He gave me some beer, a meal, and his son offered me a place to stay for the evening. This was fortunate because it was a bit chilly, I still didn’t feel well at all, and I needed some warmth for the evening.
    - hahaha, amazing. But I guess one can’t sleep at 1pm.

  - So I crashed with that guy and fell asleep watching Live Free or Die Hard (great movie, by the way.) The next day I got up, took a shower, got some coffee and bread, and headed out.
    - no care for media. Eat breakfast, drink coffee, and go out! Love it.

  - Good for them, though I didn’t want to be around when the police cleared the road and started using the tear gas…
    - lol. He’s so human-neutral. “good for them”, but doesn’t get involved or care too much about human affairs.

  - Later, Barry, a few locals, and I went and got some dinner and afterward, smoked a bowl. Afterwards, I told my friend goodbye and headed back to the town. The locals that had come with us were super cool people, and one of them paid three dollars for a hotel room for yours truly.
    - meets people, but doesn’t go along with them. He sticks to his route.

  - Larry had given me a tiny bit of weed, only enough for a few bowls, so I went to the bars to try and find someone to smoke it with. I found a cool British guy named Fred (who is the same age as me) and we went back to my small room and burned it. It looked, smelled, and tasted like dirt, but it got the job done. I went to bed shortly afterward.
    - haha, went to a bar without money, but because he had another social drug, was able to find someone. Awesome.

  - I bummed a cigarette from a guy standing near me, and he turned out to be a cool dude. His name was Luis, a tall, lanky fellow of about twenty-two years of age with a pencil-thin moustache. He told me he was going to grab a beer, and would I like to come? I told him that sounded fantastic, and off we went.
    - bumming cigarettes as a way to break ice.

  - While we were chillin’, a guy came up to us and offered us cocaine. I said no, since I didn’t have any money. Luis also turned down the offer. After the guy left, Luis pulled out his wallet and showed me an ID card.

  …Huh. Policìa National de Ecuador. He’s a cop. Good thing I didn’t buy anything…
    - hmmmmm, scary.

  - …Muy divertido!
    - lolol

  - The next morning I got up early, not wanting to miss my free breakfast. 
    - ahhhh still motivated to get up for breakfast. The love of travel.

  - After my breakfast, I went to go to the Western Union, since my good friend from New York had sent me $100 for my birthday (thanks Huggins family!) However, the Western Union in Baños was closed for some reason, so I needed to go to Ambato, forty-five minutes to the west. So, not knowing what else to do, I hitchhiked there.
    - lolol. And the hitchhiking continues.

  - When I arrived to Baños, I went shopping. I got a nice leather hat for $7, some new socks, a shirt with a graphic of El Che and the words “Hasta la Victoria Siempre!” (To victory, always!) and some underwear. I wanted to get some boots and a jacket, but my Canadian friends told me that Perù has really cheap and really warm Al Packa jackets and insulated boots that would cost twice as much here in Ecuador. So I decided to wait until I get to Lima to get that.
    - hahahah absolutely. Buy good belongings when one gets money!

  - After my shopping excursion, I went back to the hostel, took a shower, and changed into my new Che shirt (which kicks ass.)
    - lololol.

  - There was also free tea spiked with sugar cane moonshine there, which I took advantage of.
    -lolol.

  - Seventy-five cents for a huge bottle
    - !

  - The next day I just lounged around the hostel and did nothing.
    - lol, nothing

THE ORIGIN OF FECES
  - he uses a “hobo tarp” to cover from rain. Awesome utility. More robust than an umbrella. Multiple uses. Can compete with poncho, which has less uses.
  - EDIT SEPT 2011: This post is a good reason for me to tell any new hitchhiker, “bring a tent!” It’s worth it’s weight in gold.
    - it seems he had to spend money on a hotel because he doesn’t have a tent and it didn’t stop raining, and he didn’t find a covered area to sleep in?

ARE YOU POSITIVE THIS IS THE MAIN ROAD?
  - You know, it was nice to have money at first, but I’m getting totally spoiled. Good thing this is my last dollar…
    - lolol, already used it all, on gear and hotels (at convenience).
  - The rain in Macas cleared up by morning and I left around 11:30, since I slept late because these hotels don’t have wake-up call service. Whenever I sleep in a bed, I’m never up before ten or eleven. Thats why I like to camp; every day starts at sunrise.
    - absolutely. Long days.

  - I ended up paying him to avoid any trouble. He could probably get away with bashing my head in and taking my camera this far away from…well…anything.
    - ahh, lost $2 to a taxi. Haha, sometimes, you need that tiny bit of money.

  - I walked for a bit down this small, muddy gravel path. The next car that drove by picked me up, thankfully. Inside were Alberto and his son Jorge. Alberto was a square man, from his hips to his moustache. He spoke very good English, and told me that he lived in New York City for twenty-five years, proudy showing me his New York State drivers licence. We drove for awhile until we reached the town of San Juan Bosco, where Alberto lived and owned a small resturaunt. He told me I was welcome to stay as long as I liked, and that I could have as much free food at his resturaunt that I wanted. Nice…
    - these are the kinds of people to wait for, to hang out with, to stay with for a while.

  - I returned to the resturaunt several hours later, pants wet, covered in mosquito bites, but totally content.
    - hahah happiness, and knows that he has a place to shower and sleep and eat, so it doesn’t matter.
  …A good walk along a rocky stream always clears my head, even if I do slip several times on alge-covered rocks and reopen that spider-bite on my foot that I got in Colombia and that was almost healed.
    - hahahah

  - “Ahorro de Soldado Ryan”
    - lololol

  - The water looked so cool, and clear…That’s it, I didn’t care if I got dysentary, I was getting a damn drink. I bent down and drank thirstily, the cool water feeling wonderful on my parched throat. As of yet, I haven’t sufered any ill effects, and I hope that I don’t in the future. Besides, that was such a rural and remote place…no risk of human contaminates, at least…
    - hahaha, the dilemma of drinking water and risking health

  -  I made it there in short notice, where I finally succeded in posting my pictures (Patrick: 1. Slow Internet coupled with computers from the 90’s: 0.)
    - lolol, such an Ivar phrase

  - I spent my last five dollars on a hotel here, since I have the money and I may as well use it. Plus, it’s rather a large city, and I don’t feel like trampin’ it in the park tonight. Now I am back to being totally broke, and I must say I am relieved. The birthday money was spoiling me, and I was spending it on stupid hotels and friviolus Internet time. It’s good to be poor again!
    - best place to use money: city hostels, because it’s such a pain to find a place to sleep in cities. Also, it keeps the mind in tact, on target.

CAR WASHES & THE MARS DESERT
  - [todo: maybe skipped some]
  - So I stayed and washed cars for a few days there, and even washed my clothes, which was good because the last time I washed them I was in Colombia. 
    - lolol, washing clothes

  - I had bad luck there. I wasn’t able to get ahold of him, so I contacted my other friend who knows him better and eventually, after wasting nearly a week in Lima waiting, learned that he had moved to Santiago, Chile, some months ago. Great. That was poor planning on my part, though; I should have tried to contact him earlier when I was in Ecuador or something. Oh well.
    - damn, throws a week due to waiting for contact. Not the way to go. Should just continue.

  - Carlos Juan Ordoñez took a few bumps off his pinky fingernail, then offered me a bit. Well, why not…judging from his behaviour, it was some pretty good shit. He sprinkled a good sized bump on the back of my hand, and I snarked it up all in one go.
    - lololol

  - So I began walking. I walked through the entire town of Ica, rode on a motorcycle to the city limits, walked for another hour of so, and then rode on another motorcycle to the town of Santiago. Upon arrival to Santiago, I just kept walking. I was in a walking mood, I guess. Around ten o’clock, I took a break under a lone street light and set down my pack.
    - haha, just go by feeling. :)

  - An hour later, the lights of the truck stop were swallowed up in the distance, and I was enveloped in total darkness. The desert wind blew constantly, pelting my exposed skin with a million grains of weathered sand. So here I was, in the middle of a barren desert devoid even of plant life somewhere along the coast of western Perù at one in the morning. I had no water, no food, ten Soles, a sleeping bag, and a pack full of dirty clothes. The nearest town to the south was nearly 200 kilometers away. My nose was beginning to clog up from breathing in the dry, dusty wind, and my boots had reached such an advanced stage of wear and tear that sand would get inside from the numerous holes and breaches in the soles. I had no socks…my last one dissapered somewhere in Lima, and I had been wearing the same shirt and pants for the past five days.
     - hahaha, ohhh yeahhhhhh. But when it’s cold, who cares?

  …And I couldn’t have been happier.
    - :) Maybe it’s the cool weather that makes one want to walk, want to exercise. Quite different from heat.

  - I air dried in the sun
    - ahhh, such natural lifestyle is beautiful

  -  I made a mental note to spend more days being naked in remote places.
    - :)

  - I noticed a patch of aloe vera plants growing just outside of this Internet place, and I plan on utilizing the sunburn-healing powers of the juce as soon as I get out of here.
    - nice! knows at least a tiny bit about plant medicine


22/9/2016
Slept late. Woke up late. Relaxed in an the rural in 屏東縣.

Woke up to a great elderly couple talking to an aboriginal worker. They talk about various areas and aboriginals and their cultures and histories. The couple is in no hurry. Slow travel. They have a van, and in it use a ice cooler to store food and a portable gas stove. They simply park next to a bathroom and they're good to go, which makes it can better than a scooter and tent: no need to worry about food or heat or mosquitos. They live off of each other. Their kids are 30 or older. They choose new place to go every week, spend a few days there, return, re-up. It's efficient. It's slow. It's healthy. It's a good life.

It's family oriented as opposed to society oriented. Instead of working for the society, they are independent, and have enough love for each other to continue living in this way. They don't need to progress humanity. They are independent observers. They don't desire progress.
--

Being away from noise is too comfortable. But it's not reality, or, it's not enough reality. It's not enough communication. It doesn't care about what other think. It's not political. It's barely intelligent. It's mere survival. That's how I feel about American, Japanese, and rural cultures. They are material oriented, independent, a-cultural.
--

Anyway, glad to be talking again, even if it's to my phone. Talking is the most relaxing action.

I need to call the bank, then perhaps ask the police station if I can stay until I get some money. Once I figure out when the money comes, I can do everything.
--

I had many daydreams, this time of working on fishing boats off of harbors in Taiwan with migrant workers, then fighting for their payments through unionizing.

They said farms are independently owned. Not many are industrial, that's why people go to Australia: for the industrial work, which pays well.

So that seems to be my current direction. Can spend the day calling farms and harbors for work, then go along farms and harbors.

Is it better than teaching English? Not really. Teaching gives experience with kids. But teaching is a terrible thing. I'd rather just do daycare or babysit. Some more free form of self-education -- can try that school in Kyoto.

Either way, I look forward to just simply working on some old art projects. Back to simple material life. Doing my own thing. As opposed to constant philosophy, idea-generating, politics. Though, that sounds good too. I just want to be in one place and keep talking. As I did in Taipei. Talk, talk, talk. At my own pace. That's freedom. That's the ideal life.

Yeahhhhhh. :)

Slow-paced social progress. Slow kick-starting and following through with projects. Healthy body. Money. Good belongings. Good life.

But isn't Fassbinder better than this slow-paced shit? Not really. Fassbinder only communicates. The real work is done by actually talking to the people directly, and moving materials. Isn't it? It's nice to understand / have ideal morals, but without implementation, it's just awareness. People are aware but act habitually. The goal is to change peoples' habits.
--

Hmm, there seems to be two mindsets I often have: one is hyper-communicative Gemini, the other is slow, focused work. The two require different environments.

Perhaps right now, in isolation, I desire to do medical (physical) work. But once time becomes a factor, I'll desire communication. Reality, the movement of material things, is far too slow compared to communication -- any form of communication, from talking to books to films. Reality is slow.

It's so much more fun to communicate and create -- anything, with materials or information.
--

Ahhhhh, I feel so energetic, healthy. Was it the spa? Sleeping for 9 hours? I feel fuckin' great. Not thinking about others. Just want to get that money and do my own thang. Yaahhhhh!

Work work, learn first aid, learn emergency, practice parkour, make stuff, do it do it!

Research crop seasons for Taiwan and Japan.

Facebook messaged a bunch of farms. Will see what happens. If not, then perhaps it's between choosing a city in Taiwan, Japan, or New York and getting that money.

21/9/2016
Bright, beautiful day. Kids wake me up at around noon. Phew, thought it was 4pm already.

Still slow, though, listening to music, daydreaming. Feel clean. I feel like moving on. Hitching. Wherever.
--

Mmm, the sun makes all the difference when one doesn't have friends nearby. It becomes the source of happiness, the engine of action.

Some thoughts:
Communication is what makes people happy, but it's not always right. The movement of material is required or more rational. Without the work (movement of material), it's just communication.

So, farming may not be fun, social, but it's needed. I'm happier in hostels because I can talk, but it's just talk. I'm not doing the work.
--

Daydreams of living on Lanyu, and owning / managing farms around Taiwan. Understanding the work and technology and problems, redistributing supplies to workers. Lots of scootering. Lots of scenic routes. Quite like my childhood of riding and driving in the suburbs. It's rote, thoughtless, material work.

http://gogonihon.com/study-japan-wiki/Best_cities_in_Japan_to_study/live
  - Kyoto vs Fukuoka for cities. Anything else is considered rural
    - Fukuoka sounds boring, like Gaoxiong
    - Kyoto sounds like Tainan: university, traditional, and modern
      - also close to Osaka, Nara, Kobe, whereas Fukuoka is way down there
      - so, Tainan vs Kyoto? vs travel and find an awesome place in a rural area
--

Hmm, maybe school isn't such a bad idea during a lonely time. Even farming seems too lonely. Maybe I do need the city.

Should apply to some art residencies. See what's out there. Especially one's that pay, even if the pay is very little. That would be quite ideal, and conducive to art-making.

Otherwise, I'd be stuck with another job.

9/20/2016
I feel so devoid of life. Stuck, because I have no money. Too lazy to fix the problem. To lazy to live.

I’ve been barely scraping by life, eating, showering, maybe watching a film, or thinking about one. Not thinking about reality much, or what I can do to change reality, social development, the history of things in reality, and so on. Just scraping by like my younger years, lifeless.

How did I get by with media then? School was something I slept through. It was only in the films I lived. That, after school bike rides. And the travels during summer vacation. And some video games. That’s all I really remember. That was my life. Such a contrast to my post-VA life.

No, I have to move on. Get up, get out. Farm? Teach? Whatever. As long as there is life. A town. People. A neighborhood. People to care about. That’s life.

Every place I’ve lived in has people I care about. I shouldn’t have left any of them. But I did.

Yilan is the exception, which was concentrated into two people. Otherwise, the other places in my life had entire societies: neighborhoods of big cities or small towns. That’s what kept me going. Thinking of the people in them.

Go back to New York? Taipei? Bhaktapur? The hostel in Seoul? JV’s hostel in Taipei? Countless hostels in Asia, especially in Taiwan? Continue to another area in Taiwan?

They are all homes. They are all possibilities.

But I am a nomad. I live by observing, comparing, thinking, living only for a moment, then moving on. Should I be choosing a home, or just continue to live?

I should just hitch. Keep hitching until love comes again.
—

Hitching is life. Being with people is life. Doing things together is life. Living together is life.

I want to live again.

Maybe another hostel would cure me. If only I had the money.

Farming and fishing in small towns seems too lonely. I need people. I need to live with people.

Yet, the city drives people to do lame things, like consume. I just want a simple life. Long scooter rides. Picnics. River-tracing. Volunteering. A childish one. A natural one. A Taiwanese one.
—

I don’t want to be in a developed area. I don’t want to go to a 7-11, nor do I want to go to an exclusive space such as a cafe. I just want to live in my own space, as I did in Yilan, and other hostels. Having a space, a room, in a shared living building, in a shared living settlement, makes all the difference in creativity.

I want to care for others.

But not to the point of educating others. I don’t want to teach. Just care, for the survival (health, engineer, etc.), make the urban a better place to live, and just keep on creating.

Creating. Creating what? Creating new experiences; That’s life.

Live in different societies. Every living in a new society is a new experience.

Yes. Farm. Fish. Live on a boat. Live in a rural area. Live in an urban area. Just keep living.

All you need is a backpack and the ability to hitch. Nothing else matters. People can be communicated to. Family, friends, wise people. It’s the wisdom that matters. The wisdom that is shared. The experiences that are shared. A physical, material ideal is waste. A social ideal is a waste too. Keep on living. Social development is great, but don’t get stuck on it.
—

Hitching is indeed life, because it is a shared, new experience. But personal transport seems to be needed to direct toward getting work, or connecting with the right people. Yet, just riding personal transport is devoid of life.

Perhaps I need to be less directed, open. I need to open up, and appreciate everything, as I did before. No? Isn’t that the difference? Appreciating versus organizing. East versus West.

But I also want to do things, like learn and work within an emergency / disaster team, try a science gig, check out some higher-education, and so on. Make some money. So, I can’t wander around farms forever. And then with that money, make a huge trip.
—

The experience in Lanyu was great. I wanted to fish, free-dive, cook, and so on. I need to keep on stumbling upon societies like that, for a period of time, love, then move on. There was so much experience there, so much to do. I didn’t have to live there, be a part of culture, I just had to experience it with them, by living there for a period of time. But what if I did develop love there? For the people and a certain few? Would I have to stay there? Or is it just temporary? No one there shares my interests. Is it possible? It’s just a single culture stuck in time and place. I can’t be stuck like that. I’d have to move on.
—

The experience of a city is so much more. There are hostels out in the rest of Taiwan, but the cities, New York has infinite experience at every moment, every place. Towns and little islands might get stale, but the city has too many people to ever get old. Perhaps I should go back to the city? To become alive again.
—

I’m dying here. I really have no motivation to do anything anymore. I just want to continue sleeping in a quiet place.

9/20/2016 and the few days before:
[note: blogged]
ending of Only Yesterday:
I've watched the ending of the film a few times recently:
Such a great end to the film. I can't think of other animated films that can match.

> Just shake hands?

Taeko imagines a life as a farmer, with Toshio. The idea is there. The ideal is there. Then next day, she acts upon it.

When one leaves a place, a person, a society, that one loves, the reaction is that of Taeko sticking outside the train window, looking back: a mildly surprised blank expression — What now? It happens every time for me too, an awkward good-bye, then thinking while leaving. Or, a lack of thinking, emptiness. I usually take a nap being tired of packing and good-byes, and only begin thinking and living the day I arrive at the destination. Taeko, instead, stays up, with a blank expression, thinking, as the wonderful scenery passes: what now?

Go back to a simple office job? That seems crazy from this place, this moment. No, it’s natural to stay with Toshio’s family. So, why am I on a train? Where am I going? There’s no need to go.

That, compounded with the fact she felt love for the first time, makes the decision easy.

The younger Taeko tugs at her older self’s arm — C’mon! And from a blank expression to realization, she decides, and acts upon the decision.

And that’s another example of socialization in a Takahata film.

from an old temp todo:
我需要寫，因為我沒有人跟她說嗨。

在關山：
Have nearly reverted to my old independent self, of travel, of simple ideals. Not reality. At least, not social reality. Without people.

It used to be so easy to talk to people, do anything with them.

It also used to be easy to travel anywhere. What happened?

Too organized? Too plan-oriented? -- too focused on 蘭嶼? Not living the moment.

In contrast, to constantly live the moment is to live the culture of others, without thought, like a zombie vagabond.

I have rationality and desires. They and culture conflict. It's inevitable.
--

The problem is that the Japanese ideal is just that, an ideal. It's not real. Is it?

How can one simply follow a culture and forget about the rest of the world?

My past is of comparing societies, human geography. Not to simply live in one, but to compare them all, and by comparing make visible the problems of societies. Then, to decrease a society's problems by social change. That was the ideal work, wasn't it?

I've lost my ways. I've lost myself. It's difficult do it it alone, without money, **without a culture with similar desires.**

One must maintain one's own culture whilst living in others. Be independent, though social desire exists. One doesn't need others, institutions, to verify one's actions. Just do it.
--

Basking in the sun next to a farm, wherever it is, it doesn't matter. I'm back to myself in San Francisco the second time, or 宜蘭, or my first job, or my childhood. Alone, with media to communicate to. Healthy, yet anti-social, like a farmer. Listening to Utada Hikaru, taking breaks in peaceful places (libraries, parks, quiet neighborhoods, farms). At peace. Just ideas, not affecting reality. Daydreaming. Consuming very little. Communicating very little. Very little alteration to my mind and direction. Consuming media as opposed to acting in reality, like a child.

It's possible to get to this state of mind anywhere. It's personal space. It's a certain state I've entered many times previously. It's physically healthy, but perhaps useless. It doesn't involve much thought, does it? To drink tea, bask in the sun, and consume media? It's just philosophy.

Yet, at times, it's so much more than life.

This state, it just makes me simply happy, peaceful, tranquil. Not much desire. Somehow above reality.
-

The state is reached after survival. Once one survives temperature, food, then the mind can think of things far away. But it also requires transportation of the mind, either physically (riding bike or scooter) or mentally (film, music). It also requires the sun. If not, caffeine and heavy media.
-

Daydream of working with Kumiko, me being in my tranquil state, easing her with short bike rides through the picturesque.

Daydream of taking friends on trips and helping them reach their goals. A trip with Jason through Japan on his quest for animating. A trip with Ivar on an island chain of the Philippines, surviving, swimming and boating across the chain, camping.




9/9/2016 daytime:
[note: blogged, todo: review thoughts]
Japanese: おもひでぽろぽろ
romanization: Omoide Poro Poro
literal: memories trickle down
English: Only Yesterday

> Thanks to you, I finally have family in the countryside"

Oh such memories of people I've met or lived with in the countryside. The hostels and countryside houses make me so happy. Such a good life. Such sweet, good-hearted people.

> As the memories came flooding back.
-

The family gets together to eat a pineapple. So much sharing and conserving of food. Wasting food goes against culture in a huge way, perhaps due to war and history. Though now, with the industrial revolution, it's strange to see. And it still exists. It's irrational now, yet the culture still exists.

The sisters think of eating banana and eat it, as opposed to seeing something, then eating it. It's very rational-choice, as opposed to Taiwan's night market, strolling and eating anything seen. It's far less adventurous.

The girl's memories of hot springs, pineapple, rock'n'roll craze, and school build up so much, so much reality.

Japan's school culture is nuts with self-governing hall monitors making decisions. So many rules. So Japan-esquire.

:D The love sequence is brilliant. First love, so well portrayed. Awkward, but lovely. And it's the female side that shows.

Why 5th grade? A certain time is remembered.

lololol, so fun from a girl's perspective. Buying underpants in the infirmary.

The facial expressions are great too.

Hmmm, this is useless! Becoming a review, as opposed to a way to think about my next move. Argh.

Chrysalis stage? I don't remember this scene.

But when one stops working, the mind wanders, dreams, desires, an ideal life?

**Flexing female strength (ability, mind) then giving in to culture.**

Memory and then sleep. Yep. That's actually how it works. The mind wanders then contemplates.
--

Continued from the next day:
Mmm, thinking of stealing a bag is a cultural problem from the city. The interaction between city and rural changes, to being more physical, without worry. Like Jon said, in India a stranger grabbed a kid's arm to get him on the train, without asking. It's normal, in the culture of that place.

Toshio likes his car. Rural people like their materials. As do I. It's a possessive thing, habitation. And music. Zombie-like rural life. Less thinking, routine action.

Toshio likes Hungarian music, because it's farmer music, and he's a farmer. I've met aboriginals that listen to other aboriginal music before too. Aboriginals find other aboriginals relatable, and even interesting.

Toshio and his friends came to see a girl from Tokyo. Out of interest, people from small, homogenous societies often do find foreigners interesting.

Toshio, almost gets into an accident, as either he's habituated to rural driving, or just is more in tune to driving and not worrying about safety, especially compared to Japanese city folk.

I think he even curses like a local.

A famous Basho poem is recited. Neat that he reads it, also is relatable to his life.

She reads it as more of research and a bit of curiosity.

He says that the farmers didn't make money from safflower. And also in the past, they didn't make money from some red flower (crimson, rogue). It's a reality of capitalism. The merchants made the money, as they do now in India and probably everywhere.

Barbecue on the mountain. I recently had a barbecue under a bridge in Lanyu.

> "Fewer people live for their work"

> "I don't live for my job, but I don't hate it either"

> "I could farm for 24 hours a day"

His ethics are unbelievably good-hearted.

Ah, he also moved from office job to farming. Neat! Hence his enthusiasm.

The scene showing the individual farmers is great. A reality check.

Haha, rural people always care for health, tired? Hungry? It's their way of caring.

Mmm, old tales, of history.

Mmmmm, at first she thinks of resentment of city people, capitalists.

The grandmother prays toward the rising sun. Takeover watches the people, happily, and then copies, prays.

Pictures are taken, like a good trip.

She talks of history, and industrial revolution, but as I thought of while watching, some work still requires human hands, like picking tea leaves.

Rain doesn't stop people from working, even if the work is done outside. Just have to do it.

As a smarter city person, she thinks of history of the society.

> "If I could've worked like this as a child, my school essays would've been really interesting"

Need experience to write.

Haha cute, still picky about onions. I was a bit picky too. :)

The third child is always a bit more spoiled, somehow.

Mmm, grandmother says the three daughters are so selfish.

Haha father loves her, and sticks to her side. :)

Hehe, grandmother doesn't eat oily food.

Hahahaha the purse scene is great.

Ahhhh what a crazy culture, slap for no shoes. Memories.

Haha, thinking she was adopted. Normal to think that in single culture.

Mmmm, a single slap. I remember that too.

Haha spoiled brat. I was too. :)

Not sure why there was a creationist scene during the promise.

Haha touristy area because of good views. Truth.

Mmm, remembers disappointing parents. Mmm, not normal. Ah, gets the big picture in dividing fractions, as opposed to route learning.

Good move by Toshio, paralleling the math problem. "We farmers give up too easily." Giving in to culture, following normative development (against capitalism ["let's rethink prosperity", or whatever a city represents), just like her education norm.

As they walk and talk, tourism exists in the background.

> "I could never give up to it completely."

That is exactly how I feel.

Haha ski instructor, kind of like how I want to be a diving instructor in Lanyu. Physical prowess of rural people.

The history of an area is almost philosophical! Haven't seen that in an anime before, or any film. Love it. Observant.

> "That's why I felt so at home. Although I didn't grow up here, my soul was at home here. So that's it." 

Takahata romanticized nature, farmer life. Depicts it real, as a struggle, with history, but the main character also has this romantic view.

Toshio says in theory it's good, but in reality it's hard work. It's repeated, but worth repeating, as it does seem great as an idea, but very few go back.

She tries country life. A guy helped her live it.

Haha essays and creativity through a rehearsed play. She realized she could do anything. That's creativity. :) I think some of these dreams may be from Takahata's past too, as he's quite studious too.



9/9/2016
To todo: pay bills!

Continued thought for blog posts about the ideal lifestyle:

Into the Forest of Firefly Lights harks memories, of childhood and the ideal of romance. It's simple, short, and sweet, much like the experience of watching many great short films (La Maison un Petites), but at 45 minutes, a bit more impact than those instant Pixar character development sequences through memory (Up).

One thought provoked was whether this is based on an actual relationship. Of having problems in relationships due to  time, loss, or even age difference. It seems in Japan (and much of Asia), there isn't much free-time, except during those childhood summers, when there's no school and the family takes a trip into the countryside. It's here freedom, love, imagination, sparks. And perhaps, there was a relationship during those summers. People do tend to work and forget about those important things: love and family. It's only when we have a break that we focus on it. All of my relationships have been during the summer too, because I focus on work (personal or wage labour) during the other seasons. I am normally focused on work. So, for me, it brings about some good romantic memories, time spent after summer school, time spent in the park. Innocent, romance.

The second thought it provoked is of the ideal Japanese lifestyle as glorified by many of my favorite animated films.

Though the film didn't depict it as the other films have (moving to the countryside [from an urban area], building a home, farming), somewhere in that childhood freedom in nature, there it still exists.

During my time in Lanyu (蘭嶼), I wanted to experience and live in that culture: free-diving, fishing, spear-gun fishing, cooking, farming, vending, making things (commodities) from materials. It's primitive, especially when compared to my philosophic or new-media making past. It's natural science, as opposed to the infinitely more complex social philosophy. It's a material-oriented life, as opposed to an idea, information-oriented one (link to material vs information).

It's what we experience as children: learning what materials do, making things out of them. Less care for social development. **Just taking everything in and acting upon it.

Isn't that culture? To simply act within a time and space?**

There, whilst experiencing 蘭嶼, memories of JRPGs such as Harvest Moon, MMORPGs such as Ragnarok Online, one mysterious one I can't remember the name of (link to forums of most recent RO game), World of Warcraft, and the infinite other RPGs I played when I was young came. I acted the same way as I did in those games: I went out alone, learned the environment, researched the best methods, and did things: practice swimming by snorkeling, catch crabs and cook and eat them (a rather haunting experience as they are so cute), catch fish via fishing and cook and eat them, research local flora and animals and make commodities out of them, sell things through vending on the street market.

It's all quite the dream. It's all a game. **Each culture can be seen as a game.** People act according to their institutionalized cultured and habits: capitalism, passed-down behaviors, love, desire for social development, desire for wisdom. In the game of Lanyu, during the summer people capitalize through tourism (tour guides, snorkel and diving guides, accommodation, food vending), stocking money for the winter, or continue working by finding a job on Formosa (the main island of Taiwan). Catching and eating sea creatures is in their culture, from their past. The knowledge of the environment only known to those living there, and slowly disappearing due to social development of the children, and the lack of passing down of traditional ways of living from the elderly.

It's all seemingly primitive compared to the Information Age, which involves tech-related occupations, computer programming; even the Industrial Age is very modern compared Lanyu. Sure there's manufactured rice now that is imported, and some tools from supermarkets from the town closest to the port, but not much is to be seen from the developed world.

Quote from post-film thoughts of Into the Firefly Forest:
> The film is slow, dreamy, like Totoro. It has its magic. It's predictable, yet I was happy to watch it, and it made me happy, optimistic.

> For the simple things. Memories. Good times. Summers. Natural joy. Picnics. Talking. Sharing. Time.

> I think of all those memories I created in Taiwan, and elsewhere. A happier place. Instead of my cultural theory, I take in the youthful joy. Of the Chinese class, of her, of my trip in Asia, of New York, of the fatkids, of College Park, of my youth. So many memories. It's beautiful to think about.

> I've been so focused lately that I've recently stopped thinking. This free-thinking is what makes me happy. Ignore reality, and be happy.


The literal name of the film of Only Yesterday is Omiede Poro Poro, (todo: check name) roughly memories trickling down, with poro poro being a sound-action of something dripping. Poro Poro! With the cute partially rolled r phonetic. And that's a core argument for living in Taiwan as opposed to New York (todo: link to post): that living in Taiwan creates more experiences, more memories. I've only lived in Taiwan for a small fraction of my life, yet as I think of my life, much of the memories were formed there. So many adventures, friendly people, thoughts. When I watch the memories of these films, my own memories of Taiwan, an island not dissimilar to Japan, are invoked. All those people, places, things I've done. When I stop, perhaps on a transportation, just as in the film (and many other films from Ghibli), the those memories rush back, or rather, they kind of trickle down, and I desire them.

I want to go back, live them again. I contact the people. I tell them I am really cherished those times. It's s childish thing to do, yet, so human. During my recent heartbreak I took a ride a scooter from 宜蘭 through 台東 to 台南 and back toward 蘭嶼. Those memories came. I wrote to everyone I thought I may have loved during past time. I wrote it during the phase of break-up whee one seeks comfort. It was pathetic, yet affirming.

I love Taiwan. I love the experiences I've had here. I love the people here.

And so I desire to be here. I desire to join another hostel, be a part of the experiences that go in to living in one. I desire to live in Lanyu, farm and fish and vend. I desire to move to a farming area and build a home as was done in Wolf Children. But none can be done alone.

And all of this contradicts my Western mind. My Western part desires to organize people on Lanyu to increase safety, health, and engineering. It desires a better education. Yet, it desires freedom, and enjoys the freedom the kids on Lanyu have. One feels a connection there. Those children are free, unlike Taiwan. They run around town, swim, hang out with strangers.

Can both be had? Can one be rational and free? West and East?

This contradiction is an everlasting conflict.
-

Why catch a single fish with rudimentary methods when there are huge high-tech boats with nets that catch hundreds? Why farm when there are huge farm fields looked over with industrial tractors and large machines? Why not just eat cheap cereals and skip to the information and ideas? One doesn't have to fight for survival in the Information Age. Cereals are cheap, air conditioning or even simple fans exist. Why go backward in social development? We should be designing and philosophizing.

Why? Experience and memories. Nothing more.

The West focuses on the material reality. Design. The East focuses on experiences. In the West, the portfolio matters most. In the East, you must provide a biography. It's not about what you make, it's what you have experienced. The experience of making is just a small part.
-

So what stops me from experiencing? My Western past. I often think in terms of social development. Increases the development of wisdom. Figuring out cities. Figuring out cultures. Social philosophy, urban planning, all of it.

What's the point of creating yet another hostel? I should be pushing art with games for education, films with documentary and philosophical content, putting new knowledge into ever more accessible mediums. I should be in India de-slumming. I should be in an emergency care platoon. I should be doing a lot.

Yet, I feel so stable, so normal, when I am on my own, doing my own things: fishing, making games, making things on my own. Not caring for the world's problems. It's taken me many years to get this feeling again. To forget about politics is so difficult, when it affects everything.

Into the Forest of Firefly Lights [thoughts published to blog]
Last Train Home [thoughts published to blog]

3/9/2016
Again, long time no thought. Just endless little todo-lists. But that's action isn't it? Yet, I should be able to think while acting.

It's been a very primitive time, acting. The actions to do never end. I keep on creating more things to organize. Now, just like before, I get the feeling of contemplation, thinking of the big picture. This time from a nearby mountain with tea at hand. Before, with a slow-paced film. It was during these times I made decisions. I thought. Then I acted again.

You look at an entire valley, with a city and small towns. You think of what's beyond, or if one has experience, experiences of times within those spaces. In the villages in the mountains, in small towns, in cities, on other mountains.

[thought out of order]
That primitive time, on 蘭嶼, in 恆春, involved thinking. Some at least. First of creativity with material. Then it devolved to one-directional action: I had the thought, then I executed the ideas. I had the thought of creating a bamboo fishing pole, then I spent the time alone, researching on the internet to create it. Similarly, I had to research how to treat my wound, then treat it. It was terribly unsocial, against the cultural actions of the vicinity, yet it was what I desired, and did. That's a type of art. It's lonely. The goal should be to make it social, but that's not always possible. The lines don't always overlap on a graph.
--

A material-oriented, thought life is boring. There's no life. It lacks social life. It's not fun. It's as Bertrand Russell said, moving material versus telling others to. Fishing, cooking, living independently, repairing my wound; it's all boring. I thirst for social life.

My thought goes back from martial to idea. Back to media again. Reality is boring because the minds of the people are routinized by larger systems. Everyone is merely a machine formed by place, and the culture within that place.
-

Culture is only temporarily interesting. Once the mind adapts, it normalizes, and by habituation, the mind looks over it. That's the superficial desire of something new.
-

In material mode, one becomes more aware of the material -- taste of food, maintenance of personal transportation and house. One organizes material for optimal use / living. It opposes idea mode.

Long time no thought? That's too long. Maybe short thoughts on sticky pad.

Hmmm, need to move on to a different place? Mind cleared? Too clear?

A thought from earlier today:
Culture is simply an idea from the past. People who act by imitation, carry the culture: building boats, fishing, cooking, gift-giving, addictive social drugs, etc. Often, the act is conducted without awareness; it is not something decided upon by the actor. It is an unconscious action.

Somehow, abiding culture is [...? lost thought] received well? To enter a culture one must accept the culture's habits. If a culture is habituated to eat stinky tofu, it is an culturally acceptable action to make stinky tofu. Even if stinky tofu is bad for you. It (culturally acceptable actions) is not conditional. Conditional things requires thought.

Another thought:

another long day-dream; forgot about what. Probably another idea / art-related dream. Maybe about rapping. Yeah, a few hip-hop verses. One about the philosophy of hip-hop. Another about what it means for me to rap, using another culture’s medium, using another culture’s language, in another society; Taking all these cultures, not being a part of any, any institution or culture, and being rejected by them all, leaving me on the streets, in the public. Then later showing the answer through public spaces, creating spaces in public places (libraries), enacting old, simple laws such that of Romulus’s (? or whoever found Athens).

—
Long time no thought? Much music and post-break up daydreaming.

Today I had a super long thought about Ivar dying, and me reacting by creating art: penis art.

First I posted on my Facebook, “a comedian died today”.

By drawing penises on culturally important materials or images, then putting it on a Facebook page: The Ivar’s Penis Project. People caught on, it became a movement. I posted, I won’t stop until the world feels Ivar’s penis.

It led to an interview with Jon Stewart in which I told my philosophy of Ivar’s penis: I told it with a few stories: I think the first story was about the penis project. About disregarding culture, and just drawing penises everywhere. Yellow penises! I wanted for people in all parts of the world to draw penises, until it confused archeologists and anthropologists. I wanted aboriginals drawing penises on rocks. I wanted modern people drawing penises projected digitally in the sky and on the internet. The goal was simply to to make sure everyone knew Ivar’s penis. The second story was about seeing Jon Stewart twice with Ivar, once at Chrysler Hall in Virginia, and the second during his political thing in D.C. I said everyone needs Ivar’s penis. It’s what “deflates” the rest of media for Americans. It’s the Taoism in a Confucius society for the Chinese. It’s what allows people to live and play freely in an ethically strict, optimistic of social progress culture. That’s the power of Ivar’s penis. The third story was about Ivar and I living in New York, doing our routine run to Upright Citizen’s Brigade, though in retrospect useful because I go to spend time with Ivar, watching a show (in which a comedian ended with a penis joke, and it happened to be the last free show of the space), eating $1 2 bros. pizza, and heading back on the late night G train, which seemed like a waste, but in retrospect wasn’t, because I got to spend time with Ivar. After the stories, I told Stewart and the camera that I missed him. He told me he missed me many times and I didn’t respond, so it’s unfair for me to expect anything back this time.

I ended with some bullshit philosophy: the brain has a shaft, when hallow, the mind goes in circles, ruminates, digs deeper, it needs Ivar’s penis: Ivar’s penis is the filling, the answer, to carry on, to regard it all as a joke, and just continue living, because we’re all goin’ to die anyway. The takeaway of the show is to make sure you have Ivar’s penis in your mind, and if you don’t, develop it.
