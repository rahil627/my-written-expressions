There are no humans in Tainan. How have I survived for so long?

I’m nearly dead.

But I can’t work, can I? Only if the co-workers are social, happy, good?

Is it better to be in the nature of America, with cereal & milk?

No, I need the city. With the city, the choices are there: stay at home, go to a social event, hang out in the public, work, delicious food, the smartest people, everything. A stable social life, because no one leaves it.

Go to the social event, interact, become influenced by the culture of the activities there, create your own events, influence others.

Meh, but it’s gross during winter, rainy and cold and dirty and smelly. It’s only fresh during the summer. The public isn’t that great either. There’s people that volunteer at the events I go to, and, well, that’s really it. The rest are, eh.

I just miss the social, playful people, that’s all. There were social, playful people when I grew up, but then, the hagemonic way of life ate them up, turning them into boring, unsocial, non-playful, non-progressive people. So, that left the few Brooklyn dreamers to keep living and doing freely. The artificial cultures destroy everyone.

But really, all I need is a bit of money, and I’m probably happy enough on my own. Eating delicious foods, talking to anyone, if they don’t actually know how to talk, and thinking and exploring the world and mind on my own. And, I hope that never stops. That I keep exploring. Keep living. Keep trying. :)
