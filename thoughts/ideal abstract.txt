# ideal competitive and ideal maker: a game philosophy abstract
It’s quite intuitive to anyone who has played a competitive game what makes them good: Does it feel good and are you rewarded for your precise play? Is that precision still accessible i.e. can your mom play it well after a few hours? Does it *feel* good to move in-game? Are there characters that fit most personalities’ play-styles? *Are you able to express yourself through the game?*

Yet these are ideals that any single developer probably could never achieve, on their own. Instead, those things should be delegated to the community. The communities’ developers (“technicians”) should be able to make the characters and environments (stages, maps) themselves via a character maker and a environment maker, upload and download them easily, and choose which game mechanics should be on or off (think 007 GoldenEye 64, Smash series). All of this seems to lead toward some sort of *Fighting Game Maker*. And that would be really cool and all, but, that’s not a task that I would take on my own. Me, having a very conceptual personality, wouldn’t be able to focus for that long on any single project. Instead, all I can do is offer the rationality to take some initial strides towards creating more ideal competitive games.
