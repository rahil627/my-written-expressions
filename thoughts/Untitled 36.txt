to add to KS project:

# more booty:
In addition to my raw materials, I will attempt to refine two gems. They are what I feel are the most important concepts that I can offer, in writing form.

(4) A simple original one page practical guide on some things we can do right now to cause immediate changes (changes in 2pac’s sense).

(5) A simple original short writing to answer some of my most important questions: what is wrong with the world?, what is *the way* it’s supposed to be?, how to change it?, how change happens (or: what is the system?, what does life out-side of it look like?, how to live in it?, and how to get rid of it?).

I will try to keep both of these up to date as I grow old.

At the moment, I believe this is all I can offer to the world. After this project, I will surely go back into the world, losing all subjectivity again. I hope this is enough until then.

Keep your laptop safe and keep it real.

# to post-funding goals
Over the course of writing this proposal, I’ve out-lined two more sets of writings that I can add(!): (1) consolations for my past-selves and (2) a discussion comparing ways to live, especially the ways that I’ve lived and that I’ve admired (of others). At the moment, I believe these are the 3rd and 4th most important writings I can offer the world.

(1) By consoling my past states of mind of their momentary ails,—: the passionate urgent desire to change others (directly and indirectly, such as through art), to help others, to do something useful (productive, work), to find answers, to rebel, to [quickly] get out of poverty, to live(!); and, how to handle sheep—the hope is that it may console others, to reach a state of grace. (stoic, personal talks to myself)

(2) By comparing and talking about the ways I’ve lived and acted in my past, I hope it will lead to some more consoling thoughts, in order to provide us with some ways to live calmly. Should I/we live naturally (according to one’s nature) or live altruistically? Should I/we act as a saint, an anarchist, a female, or my/our true ourselves? Should I/we do something instrumental (“rational”) or just follow my wolf instincts? How did I *feel* when I lived in such ways? How did I *feel* when I lived in such and such environments? What are the pros and cons of each state of mind and/or ethic?

Although important, I don’t think they are as important as actually (irl) consoling and caring for people via plain communal organizing; So, I’m just adding them here, separate from the main project scope, as something I could do during the nights after the transcriptions are complete. Let’s say at $4000 and $5000 respectively, I’ll add them to the project and an extra month of time for each, maintaining the minimum wage rate of $1000/working month. This fits well as I need the transcriptions to aid me in these two endeavors. It also fits because by the end of it all, it will be hot again. I hope my summer instincts don’t take my mind over before then…

Yeahp. That’s the maximum “work” one wolf can handle for another 10 years.
