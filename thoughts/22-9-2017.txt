Ahhhhh, a warm day, again. The perfect day to busk outside. All I’m missing is a speaker and cable. Fuck.

Fuck, just accidentally deleted some text because of this iPad keyboard!

Anyway, last night I was able to ask the guy near the temple to help me charge devices. He said okay; but then he said some things that generated some antagonism: he ask when I was going home, that I should get an apartment, asked prices for a ticket home—saying I should sell everything and then flying back. As if those things were easy or desired. He knows I’ve been sleeping in the park for more than a month and has never done anything to help.

**That this precisely the mind of Taiwanese culture: they talk but don’t do shit.** They look, see terrible things going on, but don’t do anything to change the people or environment around them. They often lie, saying they will, but never do. They might look for / offer me work, offer help to find my lost phone, offer a place to stay, then, they disappear. That was the case many many times. **They don’t care.**

**They are hypocritical slaves.** They have the knowledge of bad things, yet, they continue life doing whatever they are conditioned to do: institutionalized wage 
labor, encultured work (sell commodities / service).

I hate them all. Perhaps the city is needed after all. **Although city-goers aren’t environmentally-conscious, they are at least conscious, mallealable humans. The people of Taipei are infinitely better than the people of any other city in Taiwan.** They talk, do, act, change far more frequently than the slaves that reside in the other cities, whom all blindly accepted their faiths in capitalism, or whatever religion.

**Caring individuals are rare: mothers, hippies, humble artists, scavengers.** These are the only humans left.
