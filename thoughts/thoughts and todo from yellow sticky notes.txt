# main content
## 1
pondo(?) vs not

worry vs not
  - Colorful
survival vs higher

knowledge from people vs material movement / exp.

to thoughts:
1. family is amazing, but boring. Need friends of my own; And not be bad to others, not disappointed.
  - tried to go to garden, picnic, etc., but couldn't get my family out. Too comfortable? Too routine?
2. farming? out of reality?
3. to blog / think: info vs reality
 
be happy, outgoing, like Patrick

## 2

feel dead, uninspired, without people, without social life

try to live like apartment, make own tea, avoid plastic, eat rice / noodles (x eat veggies!), learn how to cook 驢肉飯.
.
talk! still. girls. travel (**need girls / talking**). capitalism. social development.

love / social vs material
compare societies
-
watch people / society
= contemplative films, scooter, etc.
-
to think. write.
travel vs living / culture

thoughts:
suburban 墾丁,
only money / capitalism,
no love or passion,
too narrow,
no creativity,
organized for capital
-
tourism, property, food
-
commodity
-
feels terrible
-
as opposed to experience

no culture, mind, media-oriented

## 3
culture vs capitalism

creativity vs culture / family

## 4 newer, from Japan
Also during travel, talking is travel. No need to move the body for mere survival -- talk, share, minds (/ understand), decision-making, letting(?) people live / do whatever they want to do.

Japanese people [culture] look, but don't act. Taiwanese people talk (and look), but don't act. Americans act(, talk, and look).
  - successful culture vs slave mentality

## 4.2 another one from Japan
 apple pear liquor, zero vs juice

** $lost notebook at JV's hostel? vs airport**

$1 baguette is best deal, + $1 strong zero at night

Japan is populated by rule-based automatons, beyond the cities of Taiwan. There are no humans -- culture replaced the individual mind. They are the eusocial ants Patrick talked about. Thus a society full of them turns out rather dystopian as opposed to communism ideal.

Japan's commodities fit Zizek's idea of desire without the bad stuff -- coke zero, strong zero, light cigarettes, etc.

Japan's industrialized food industry could waste more manpower (machine labor + ?) over individual / indie stores in S.E. Asia. All of it is alienating the workers.

Japan [...too difficult to read]

Japan's urban planning works for bikes, but just okay for humans because not many places to hang out. They are all indoors. Probably like Holland.

Nothing beats 通化街.

Without hostels, class, work-spaces, outdoor markets, how else does one meet people? Talk to people at their neighborhoods?

AnnoLab gave exclusive place feel, like much of Japan's culture; There are cameras everywhere.

inspired by "go east" blog post by Peter
  - **keep Peter as ideal, not Ghibli films**
    - [todo:] to blog
  - that's all that's ever needed
  - get better at camping,  being free, hitching, losing desires, gaining movement
  - doesn't pay for transportation or housing. Wild!
  - **VA / NY money -> France to Japan to Lanyu / Taiwan**

Notes on comfy-making:
* pleasant lighting
* pleasant cooling
* pleasant ambience
  * people, animal, etc.
  * pleasant music

spill out to public / street / nature
cool / hot water
  + tea

# 2
Thus, I may be restricted to [the] east coast during the winter, and 台北 [or now, 台南] during the summer.

That simple happiness of riding my bike, is so desirable. Free in thought. Freedom of thought. It views the world. No addictions necessary, just exercise.

# 3
Loss of aesthetic, thought, progress, human behavior. Loss of motivation. Just living. Barely, like a pot-smoking hippie.

Document the beauty of Taiwan
* design
  * house
  * public
  * vending commodity
* culture
  * behavior
  * politic
    * consider others
  * pros and cons

  * institution
  * power
  * recycle

design ideas?
  - vs actually implementing them? Small town? **Neighborhood?** No cars / scooters.
  - [Neighborhood]
    * homes as best / most livable place
    * + nature, meet-ups, natural paths

# 4
take care of people, nature; all.

protest against development.
  - fight, document, etc.
    - fight all organizations / institutions?
      - Facebook / **indie media** / video like Vice
      - [indie media]
        - critical theory
          - thoughts
       - threat / money demand

[those are] methods
  - what about non-media consumers?

vs survival ideas, environmental ideas, etc.

mother earth news
cool tools
natural tech?
information?
  - **bike / scooter / train**
talk

# 5
cool tools
* solar panel bike design
* Honda Cub / underbone motorcycles
* 阿莊's truck
* 八寶's truck

* 能盛行's space
* 藝文嘍's space
  - go to people's homes to see home designs
    - improve material choices, nature, home-made, minimal
    - compare urban designs --> [to next page]

problem of concrete, development

# 6
**need a home to desire to improve it, to take care of it.**
  [- problem of external freedom, meaning, need the freedom to change the environment to improve it, to take care of it]
  - not 台灣 plastic, not 蘭嶼 disregard, some natural aboriginals
    [- it seems here I desire a society with natural, smart people in nature]

need town / city?
  - need place with similar values / beliefs
    * natural values
    * near nature
    * but still care for beyond survival? Still smart, not to fall for development. **Hippie communities, in nature by choice.**

natural!

[points to need town / city?]

# 7
or, no media? no media creation. just live? care. film / video at most.

no antagonism. just harmony.

**fill media with videos of good life.**
* nature, health, care
* documenting, good, healthy neighborhoods?
  - like Japanimated films

# 8
**unify Taiwan east coast (and mountain) against development**
* **indie media**
* **progress meter. How much lost? How to re-nature what was lost?**

**label nature.**
**document ideas / label [name and locate] ideas**
**history of environment?**

**time spent in nature, exercise as wellness.** No yoga, etc.
  - bike, train, scooter

# 9
keep nature in proximity.
**use internet / postal service as means to obtain wealth from the world.**

# 10
capital-lifestyle vs all-encompassing (natural)
  - [capital-goal-oriented-behavior vs holistic, natural behavior]

# 11
buy a keyboard and play it on the streets
clean nature

# 12
good health:
use air conditioner
shower
positive music

# 13 (starting from at least here, is written at Jim’s house)
A neighborhood in the suburbs may be cheaper, but is the worst place, because the neighbor’s are old, stupid, unequal, habituated, non-thinking, as nothing occurs in their neighborhood.
  - [written] after experience of walking around Jim’s neighborhood.
  - [written later in red ink] but so are farmers and city goers? Less so!
    - **Fuck it all, live in nature.**
      - **or, in a home, anywhere.** only two choices

It is best to either live alone, or, in a good city neighborhood; or in a good smaller community (anarchic community), still need physical day / night markets.
  - online communities?
  - physical public marketing

# 14
**farmers / foragers next to modern technologists**. Skip all in-between culturally-habituated non-sense. Nature and information / digital.
  - smartphone, audiobooks, etc.

[to todo:] todo later:
Taidong EMT associations
farming associations
“survival” associations
use ear plug on motorcycle!

# 15
Waking up in a hostel, nature (camp), home (suburb), city, all result in very different actions.
  - hostel -> travel with people, maybe touristy
  - nature (camp) -> travel -> **freedom**
  - home (suburb) -> media -> material -> **no [real] experience**
  - city -> city mind / people -> **mass experience**

Waking up outside results with sun in eyes, 7AM wake up, tired, but the world in view. [written in red ink:] - mountains, sky, beach!

Wake up inside results with information in eyes, wake up late, but refreshed, focused, healthy body, cram much information.

# 16
“real is responsibility, real is taking care of your family, real is God, nigga.”

# 17
[to todo:]
read/watch Chris’s messages
read Kumiko’s messages

natural straps to belongings
natural nets

[bag packing diagram, from top to bottom]
common stuff
clothes
electronics parallel to the back
  - laptop
unused clothes

just need a new, zipper backpack

# 18
Lonely Planet? Other travel books?

# 19
tradition and capitalism
  -> tradition -> at home, cooking, media
  -> capitalism -> in the world, eat out, real experience

**how to provoke others to live simply?**
  - **model [behavior]** (parents, farmers, hippies, etc.)
  - media (lives of others)
    - ethics, ways to live

**must live on the road
in the city
outside**

- - -
# 20 (starting from at least here, is written on the east side trip)
$$$ life as a series of cooperative-living communities
$$$ start from nothing - live in nature, build / obtain as necessary (life philosophy / knowledge)
 - including medicine (f.e.: 蘋果/凱維 brushing with water)
$$ environmental knowledge / ethic increases, more difficult life, but way more thoughtful, in-cultured / habituated

from next day:
need city, people, culture, too lifeless alone, at home.

must care for others, talk, live

isolated house (suburb, VA, India, Jim’s), only nice for a few days, then must go out! Into the city. Do things with people. Get back to the world.

# 21

## thoughts
mornings thoughts:
Talked to some old guy about places to live. He importantly mentioned 宜蘭縣 is humid and rainy, thus making 花東 the best [by weather]. He also mentioned 花蓮’s weather is about the same as 台東 [thought I felt it was somehow even more humid]. He also importantly mentioned that being more than 30 km away really is a hassle / inconvenience.
