[night at the boat bonfire:]
Sapiens. Could write a complete reaction to it. Would it be worth it? I’m not so sure.

The religions chapter is so boring. He goes on like the theologian he is spitting out definitions of religious ideas. What’s important is at the end: humans fail to have consistent beliefs. Their beliefs often contradict each other. So, as he goes over all of the non-sense, he admits that no one could ever follow it anyway.

The truth is that no one really reads or gets knowledge, and actually acts upon the morals or ethics within it, except, perhaps, theologians. A Christian American believes in Christianity as much as a Japanese does Shinto and Taiwanese does Taoism and Indians do Hinduism,  which is, barely, randomly, and inconsistently. It doesn’t even matter if they are animist, polytheist, monotheist, or dualistic.

A Christian American can believe that abortions are bad, homos are bad, Satan and Hell exists, the American State’s enemies are Christians enemies too, Coca-Cola is good, praying during stupid life events is right, fate exists, karma exists, there is only one god and admit there are many other gods, black and brown people are scary and some are good, a singular energy exists, nature have spirits, astrology, is democratic, and so the contradictions and non-sense continues.

To me, this way of thinking almost has nothing to do with religion, except the fact many stupid religious ideas exist in the world, being preached, passed around, including in the book of Sapiens.

The contradiction in all of this is: why even bother to study religion when most humans are so stupid that they can’t hold a single belief for longer than a day? One should be studying how stupid humans are.

It’s not religious texts or knowledge that passes, rather, it’s culture, and the adaption of the normative culture that contains the non-sense values. It’s not that some book says abortions and homos are bad. It’s that those two beliefs are the social norm of a society. Going against that belief goes against the social norm. I feel, the social norm is way more important, as peer pressure will force one to go against one’s individual beliefs.

I remember in elementary school, people would ask me, “do you have a religion?”, “do you believe in a god?”. And I usually say no to everything. But, I believe, there was one point, where the questioning got me to saying I might be agnostic. I just was trying to not upset the more “religious” kids. That’s as religious I’ve ever gotten. It was sheer peer pressure. All sorts of people, adults especially, will stereotype you as Hindu or whatever, but luckily, Hindu is was just something I celebrated on Hindu holidays with super soakers with paint, like Christmas, and, it has even more, sillier-appearing gods that I couldn’t believe in.

My Filipino American friends for the most part say they suffered from the Catholic Church that their first generation parents adhere to fiercely. At some young age they end up hating it, but still live happily with their parents.

Similarly to being pressured to have a religion, I believe those same pressures are the cause of having the wrong beliefs about abortion, equality, freedom, “politics”, and, well, everything. It’s not because a religion said it. It’s because the idea somehow spread through a culture and stuck and was passed down through generations. Probably through state-forces, you know, some empower or president says brown people are bad, or, homos, or, the opposing political parties are against the prevailing social normative beliefs.

An American has these beliefs because the culture that American grew up in has them, not because of religion. Even the wrong ideas probably didn’t originate in religion, but, rather, was probably just super-imposed onto it, to create a culture that fits the social norms of the dominating rulers.

So, to me, tracing history never really matters much. One could find the origins of things, but, it’s always better to just do what’s right, ignoring where all of the wrong ideas came from. It’s nice that Foccoult traced institutions, but, it’s even better to just get rid of of those terrible institutions because they are simply terrible, at face-value.

The truth is that most humans are stupid. It doesn’t matterwhat  their beliefs are. Beliefs will be forgotten with a little bit of force or money anyway.

I wouldn’t even call them beliefs. Humans will just do anything. Most people don’t have beliefs and follow them. Instead, they just live through the day. It’s the people who have the idea of these beliefs that super-impose it on them. In reality, there aren’t many beliefs. Anything works. Ask the public if they have certain beliefs, and they’re probably unsure themselves. It all depends on the context, not the beliefs. Even if the person says they have beliefs, they won’t actually act upon them, it really depends on the context of the situation. Everything is situational. Perhaps it’s these theologians that think everyone actually has deep beliefs and adhere to them.

[Bhuddism:]
Again, Harrari goes over the conceptual definition of Bhuddism. Yet, again, he admits in the last two paragraphs that 99% of people never reach nirvana, and furthermore, end up worshipping gods with prayers and flowers just like any other religion.

So, the question is, why do 99% of humans act that way, not another religious idea. Why do humans consistently give hope in the power of another entity, whether it’s the government, the president, gods, or otherwise? Maybe several answers: humans are meek and stupid, it’s easier to let some other entity take care of everything else (homeless people, people in poverty, people with disabilities, etc.), it’s comforting for the mind, it eases the mind. People merely live and pray for better days. There isn’t much more to it. **They do not take responsibility. They put the responsibility in some other’s entity’s hands because it’s easier.** **Few stand up. Few could call themselves vigilantes. Few call people out. Few take action.** **Those people are people with morals and the ability to act upon them. Those are rare, anarchists, watchmen, whatever.** **Most humans follow social norms and are passive.**

[Humanism]
Again, Harrari, and detaching religion from reality.

Communism, [to him, ]unfortunately, is Soviet Communism. [He further adds norms and values to communism, upgrading it from a societal order / structure to a religion. What are the norms and values of communism? Be yourself?] Anarchists are face-palming.

Humanism[, to him,] is individual humanism and social humanism. People who just simply care about humans, human rights, go to Africa as emergency medical technicians, or whatever, all are turned into simple concepts...

I guess this is the what’s necessary for a brief history of the world, but, here, it seems to be leaning toward a brief history of ideas rather than the world. And, like the history of philosophy, it is completely void of reality: it’s just a bunch of concepts that academia created over time.

Nazism, an “evolutionary humanism”, is somehow compared with the other two. To me it’s a quite a bit more radical. Anyway, even here, he only goes over the core belief: That the Aryan race is superior. Instead of the reality, which is, some crazy dictator, his crazy club, their crazy army, are forcing upon the nation, through all sorts of means, to purge our other peoples by force. I mean with guns, propaganda, etc. To detach the religious idea from that reality is the real sin.

Again, the belief is a small part. The main influencer is that everyone is doing it: it’s the culture. If one day the American government started to purge itself of homos, I believe up until even the 90s, especially outside of liberal cities, people would actually follow. Maybe random citizens wouldn’t kill, but surely treat unequally in other ways, exposing what’s really on their mind. Maybe beat them up on the streets. It wouldn’t even require propaganda. It still occurs!

I don’t know Germans well, but, there are a lot of cultures, especially of countries with 99% of the same race, where racism similar to German’s pre and post Nazi racism. The idea is already in the culture. One can feel it. Whether it’s Danish people, Japanese, Taiwanese Chinese, probably most eastern and north-eastern european nations, probably most of those 99% race nations. All are extremely racist. You know once you go there. There’s a word for the other peoples. There’s a treatment for other peoples too.

So, to briefly go over the ideas really just doesn’t help. It’s just something that was super-imposed on an idea that already existed: racism. The religious belief is just validation, to be racist. It’s not that suddenly white supremacy came about. It’s that racism always existed, then, small group decided to spread the radical idea. That part, I would agree, is like a missionary religion.

[Going back to an older thought:]
Why did Christianity take over? Was it merely Constantine’s choice?

I think where god comes in is often during the hardest parts of life: praying for human essentials (food, water, shelter), good health, going through a hard time [in life], praying for better days, etc. What else do you do? Something spiritual.

Like the fact that most people are racist (to some extent. I’d say nearly everyone acts on cultural stereotypes, before knowing the person), many people have religious beliefs, like, there is a god (agnostic?), fate, after-life, and so on. It’s just there. All of the relious crap is super-imposed. Sometimes to extreme degrees, just as Nazism is to racism, so too, Catholicism to godism.

Why? It just occurs. There are differences between people. There could be differences that most people may not like (black, homo, trans, etc.). Perhaps don’t perform hate acts, but surely treat differently, unequally.

**Why? Because people are narrow-minded, desire a certain organized order of things. People want other people to behave in certain ways, likely similar to them [or similar to a slave.]** That’s all. The origin of racism isn’t that complex.

**The origin of racism is the same origin to most wrongs in society (unequal treatment). It’s this desire for a social norm, a set of values and behaviors, either of their own set or an imagined set, that creates exclusive behaviors.** From there, anything can happen, and it’s not hard to take advantage of those already existing exclusive behaviors.

In rural areas, parochialism (todo: word check, extremely narrow rural mind) is everywhere. If you’re not part of one village or town, you will be treated as an outsider, an other. So, given 10 villages, all 10 could be exclusive to all others. Treating others differently, not caring for, not working with, treating others as strangers, fearing others, and so on.

Indians from Gujarat act this way. People have family networks linked to neighborhoods. It’s best to marry within the neighborhood, or a family lineage within the neighborhood, or, at least the city. For such a massive country, it’s surprisingly parochial even in the messy cities, but especially the rural areas.

Taiwanese Chinese act this way too. If one isn’t from Tainan county, the employers are so parochial that they won’t hire people from other areas. It doesn’t matter that they’re [the employees] Taiwanese Chinese.

**What matters is that you are not a stranger. You are something familiar, with similar values and norms. Maybe you eat a similar cuisine. Maybe you talk with a similar accent. Maybe they know someone you know. But any slight differences, and, well, the exclusive behavior symptoms may appear!**

Is it merely strangeness or is it fear? A little of both? **It’s an aversion to other things.** It could lead them (the exclusivists) to feeling repulsive. Like, ugh, you eat with your hands!? You savage! lol. Fear or strangeness? One can see both in their eyes.

When it’s not both, it’s clear. The person is just inquisitive, curious. Those are signs of being somewhat open-minded. Yet, that doesn’t mean equal treatment. Just not fear. You’re still strange! You’re probably never able to share a dwelling or work together.

The day you are not strange in their eyes is the day that they added you into their group, ever so slightly increasing the things that they include, consider equal, treat equally.

This can happen within one generation in America. One simple way is that someone in the family marries someone strange. Finally, those parochial minds will do some churning. Or, you know, remain salty family members forever.

Again it seems rural areas are the worst and cities are the best. Though, city kids might themselves dislike rural kids for the same stupid reasons. So, it’s still there.

Only open-minded groups, such as artist communities (not the instituonalized ones either) really exhibit inclusive behaviors. Anarchist communities are basically just conscious artists communities. I’m really not sure of any others. Hence, that is precisely where I try to live most of the time.

[Going over another missed thought:]
Yuval keeps doing that annoying thing that philosophists (philologist? the people that merely study not create philosophy?) do: claim that one idea came from a past idea, as if the billion humans couldn’t re-create the idea... This time, liberal humanism’s tenets (ideas) of freedom and individualism comes from Christian notions (ideas) of free(?) and soul... Ugh. Sure. No one thought of freedom or independence...A history of ideas is terrible. Let it die with academia.

Freedom and individualism is sort of just inherent in some personalities. I was a rather free and independent kid, growing up in the [American] suburbs, biking around the neighborhood and consuming media on my own. Those values came from within, and with the nurturing help of the culture of my environment. These two particular traits though, I’d say came from within. Though, if I grew up in India, it sure would have been really difficult to be so independent, as I had my dependent phases later in life living in Asia. I would need to have been spending a lot of time at home, not with peers...

Perhaps religions can be matched to personalities! More social personalities to social religions. More independent personalities to independent religions or beliefs. It even seems natural. For some people to be liberal, or even anarchist. Others being part of some social structure with all sorts of norms: most religions. Yeah, I can see that happening. I mean, personalities seem to have inherent values.
