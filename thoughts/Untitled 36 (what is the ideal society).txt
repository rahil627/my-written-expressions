# What is the ideal society?
First, what the fuck is a society?

## What the fuck is a society?
The dictionaries give different definitions, so, we can’t rely on them. Besides, we we can’t trust Oxford about giving truthful definitions. They will likely mis-define everything, being sheepy followers of [the science religion](c=‘science’).

One hears of traditional societies, primitive societies, modern-societies, and so on. What’s the difference there? Technology, beliefs, values, habits (customs, traditions), environment, the state of the world! So, it’s everything. Great.

Society, let’s just say, is a group of people that sort of live together, especially nearby. Usually, large in size, consisting of many groups of people within it-self. By sort of live together, I also meant, sort of get along with each other: able to communicate, understand each other. Some-one from a primitive society might have trouble understanding one from a modern urban society.

Good enough.

But, that’s not what I want. I don’t care about a particular group of people, or even the people!, as much as a certain set of behaviors, moral precepts, perhaps derived from values and beliefs. What is that called? Culture?

## What the fuck is a culture?
Shit. This never ends, does it?

What is the difference between American societies and American culture? Culture doesn’t include the people. American work culture? It’s more of a feeling almost. But yes, it absolutely includes habituated behaviors. It also includes shared knowledge. I don’t care about knowledge though. I care about a few specific behaviors when people interact with each other, specifically, how people treat each other. What’s that called?

## What is the ideal set of behaviors that you are looking for?
Fuck, now it sounds like a religion. Well, I guess it is a religion! Fuck! Anarchism is a religion? Yeah, I guess it is... Anarchy is a society with Anarchism as its religion. Man this shit will never catch on now. A religion that throws bombs is what the governments will call it. That *is* what they call it…

Ideal?

## What I mean by ideal
Well... Goddamnit. My definitions of words are all different. What I mean by ideal is: the best possible choice; the best feasible possibility.

Now then…

## What is the best feasible set of behaviors for people to have?
It’s not *the* set of behaviors, as in a full set. It’s just a few precepts, principles that people should have. Like a minimal set. **In order to maintain order, and prevent disorder. And similarly, to maintain equality, and prevent inequalities from seeping in.**

## What is the best feasible minimal…religion?
Fuck that sounds terrible.

## What (minimal) principles should humans follow in order to become a good society?
Ah, now that’s the question! And now we go on to create our own religions…

[todo: archive the above as ‘the thoughts that lead up to’]
# What are the minimal set of principles that humans should (strive to?) follow in order to become a good society?
Anarchism says: **Don’t coerce others. Basically, don’t force other people to do things. Don’t order others. Don’t use others(?).** [Alternative words: compel. Other bad words: authority, power.]

**That’s it. That’s anarchism.**

**Anarchism *is* the principle to not coerce others.**
 
**From that single principle, Anarchy blooms.**

Anarchy is a society based on anarchism.

Take some time off to think about that. Actually, take this entire month to think about that. That most outcasts that have ever lived (dreamers, believers, hippies, punks, rebels, refusers, etc.) relies on a single principle.

[todo: what is love?]

## How the fuck is that possible?
Simple, but like a some simple games, it generates infinite possibilities and complexity.

**When you want another person to do something, you have to negotiate with that person.** This negotiation is what I call politics. (But again... perhaps my words and meanings are mixed up...).

So, every-time you want some-body to do some-thing, you have to negotiate. Whether it’s done through talking, body-communication, whatever. Whatever the form of communication, there has to be a mutual consensus, an agreement, to do whatever it is that the forcing person wants.

***Every-time.*** Every-time!

...

## Cheats: Money, Property, Government, and more
Though there is only one principle that is anarchism, there’s another problem.

Over thousands of years of human inhabitance, a few ideas that break the principle have spread and have been adopted by nearly all human societies in the world today. Let’s call them *cheats* (alts: principle-breakers, rule-breakers, heresy, shenanigans).

The primary cheats of importance: money, property, and government. There are more, but, this is already enough to handle for the moment. [todo: list more]

Money-owners cheat by using (exchanging) money in order to coerce you to do something.

Property-owners cheat by coercing you to exchange valuable stuff (money) for merely spending time within an area of land (with or without a building on it) that they “own” (…and then they go on to use money-owner cheats with all of the money they’ve collected).

Governments cheat by coercing you to in a bajillion ways (—a list so long and cruel that I will post-pone explaining them for now [todo]—), and become the most evil of the cheaters by sending you to prison (a place with the most *coercive relations* [anti-anarchist or authoritative]) when you don’t obey. Also, they magically make the money!

That’s right! The governments make money which allow people to coerce each other, own a lot of property (“public property”), freely coerce you in a gazillion ways, and coerce you when you break their religion of infinite principles (“laws”) that no human can remember, whose sole purpose is distract you to allow them to freely coerce you at will, coercing you to go to prison or coercing you to pay them money.

History cheats by favoring people who inherited money, property, government employment, and social relations / networks to them all, because coercive people mostly befriend other coercive people, and, because the money continues to accumulate. [todo: needs work]

So, although *the principle* can be and is being followed by people in the world today and every past day, without getting rid of all of these cheaters, those few people will eventually run into cheaters, perhaps every time they leave their home. [todo: cut?: If one doesn’t have money, property, government employment, or, good relations with any of those things, then, one is more likely to become the victim of the cheaters.]

## How anarchism exists in the world today
That’s right, anarchism exists everywhere continuously since forever. Everywhere there is isn’t coercive relations: in the relations of: children, friends, peers, shared-dwelling-mates, work-mates, class-mates, healthy families, and even the people in public places. It can’t be stopped. It’s normal! **It’s how we’re supposed to get along.**

It just so happens to exist simultaneously with a bunch of cheaters.

Cheaters will always spring up. But at the least cheats can be either reduced or even gotten rid of completely.

## Avoiding cheats: to beat the cheaters without cheating
[rename cheats to cheat-codes? cheat sheets! lol]

Stopping the money cheat.

Stopping the property cheat. To stop the property cheat, you must either live in a place where you do not exchange money for property […or?]. To reduce it, you must either move to an extremely cheap property (including out of the country),

Stopping the government cheat.

## Cheating the cheaters
Some-times you can’t simply avoid the cheats. You love your home, your property. You love your neighborhood, town, city. You love it so much that you could never avoid.

For that, you will lik


Equality? Consideration? Care?







## What is the ideal society?
Hmmm… Now, what is ideal? Hmm… Damn! I keep running into problems with my definitions of words. I guess what I meant was:

## What is the best feasible form of society?




# cut
There’s really no way to separate one society from another nowadays, so, one could say we are all living within the same global society! Yet, there’s quite a difference between the societies of New York City and the farming societies out-side of it (if there are any…).
