night, of packing in Tainan:

Phew, finally some cool weather late night.

Been some time since I’ve written in here... Sometimes I’d write on paper, but... lately... not much.

Perhaps one cant even write when one must constantly take action to survive?...

Nah, I’ve just been out of it. Brain dead.

Packing is the beginning of another adventure. The brain focuses on packing, then, on to the next area. Only after I’m done packing, can I alter my focus on the rest of the world.

It’s a pain, packing... Especially as I have such strong recycling and scavenger traits...

Does packing for me always reduce to a backpack? I mean, that *is* all I can take on an air-plane... If I had a car, I’d surely have more (kitchen-ware, tools, etc.).

Anyway, it’s all crap that I’ve hoarded over time. Surely it’s my fault, even if there are people throwing junk next to my dwelling...

The next place I live should be completely empty. A tent on a beach? A beach shack?...

Shifting my mind from the area around me to anything else is extremely difficult. It really requires me to stop caring (about the surrounding area). So, packing is a good inter-period, where I am neither caring about my place of departure or destination. It’s strange. A vacuum. A room.

Is it worth the time to pack? Environmentally? Or am I doing it to clean after my-self? Money is definitely not a factor this time... Mmm, the second reason.

For whatever reason, I have to leave cleanly. I have to clean my room, contact everyone in the area, make sure anything pending gets done.

Ahhh, I can’t wait to get out of here! Almost there! Almost there...
