Yo. I applied via angel.co quite some time ago; It matched and someone said to e-mail here. My resume should be attached. For memory’s sake, here’s what I wrote to angel.co:

> This just seems like an ideal fit really: the position, the subject, plus the ability to work at home.
>
> Since an early age I’ve always wanted to do something toward health but because of my skepticism of human ability beyond survival, it has led me to stick to simply taking rounds to serve the people on the streets.
>
> Also, unfortunately, since I live in Taiwan, I can’t do emergency health (the only part of the system that I feel may fit me) because health systems are closely linked to government, giving non-Taiwanese zero chance to start.
>
> Thus, being a cog for someone else’s rationalization for a moment is quite a relief. I quite enjoy the testing cog, as it evokes a feeling one gets when cleaning things, but with way more efficiency.
>
> If coding is necessary, then, given time [and a laptop], I could prepare to get in the mood and habit of mind by setting up office and making some small video games. It’s been some time...

I wanted to reply earlier but was waiting for a better time which never coalesced—a friend still hasn’t returned my Macbook to me, and I wasn’t able to move homes. As I’m returning from a visa trip, I just decided I’ll just send this old letter anyway:

> Looking at the resume, you’ll see this is quite a turning point in my life, a definite momentary return to capitalism. Anyway, this is perhaps the best moment for it: the season is right (summer-time), [I’ve] got my mind right, and my intention is simple: I just want to save a bit of money so that I can begin building my dream community (and shelter) on the natural side of Taiwan; This position seems like a really really good way to do those things, without too much ethical sacrifice.
>
> Medically, the east side of Taiwan could be an interesting case too: it feels like it lacks health education and care, so I’m unsure where health-care comes in. Imagine: aboriginals forced by capitalism (and its institutions) to do wage labor contracts with 12 hour work-days toward development (construction, transportation), industrial farming (betel nut and fruit trees), or factory work on the west side, [while] chain-eating betel nuts to beat the heat and have energy, or otherwise drinking cheap “whisky” industrial chemical alcohol; Their choices almost completely determined by the system. The result: broken homes and broken people. Where to begin? Also, where does health-care end?
> 
> Furthermore, simple ideology informs one that much of the workers in Taiwan’s government positions (health, including emergency care) are the unconscious paper-pushing sort, a result of Chinese-cultured passive-inducing education and institutionalization. That, along with a culture that sucks at being responsible or truly egalitarian, really leaves people to trust themselves.
> 
> Thus, I doubt an app can solve this, but, on the other side, I’m sincerely all for making good tools to transform the special individuals that try into robocops, precisely because, at this point, those special individuals with good work ethics are all I trust. My greatest hope is that the app is a simple, practical, minimal tool that facilitates healthcare workers to do whatever they do, much in the way that great creativity tools (game, film, music, and writing apps) have aided me in my own past.
> 
> From a quick glance at Wikipedia, I’m reaaallllyyy glad to see it is entirely focused on the basics of healthcare, especially basing itself in African settlements. (You know... in contrast to the uselessness that Silicon Valley dishes out...)
> 
> Fuck yeah, I’d be down with this! :) ...
> 
> Available times: At the moment I’m usually around wifi from 1:30pm to 5pm and again from 9pm to late night (Taiwan time, 12 hour difference to American eastern). Life’s still a bit messy (temp. work, move east again, etc.), but I can always stop all that for some proper work.
