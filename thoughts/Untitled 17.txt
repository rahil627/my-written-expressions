The world, especially the rural areas, is full of inequali relationships.

Bosses still act like masters to their slaves. But, instead of dissecting this through cultural reasoning, I’ve been thinking of personality-based reasonings...

A majority of people can do stupid institutionalized work, every-day. Many personalities can’t. The minority of people, which contain quite a diverse amount of personalities, will lose the the stupid people with hard-working ethics. They work without reason, without thought, without conscious. The idealists just have to bare it, at least, for a few wages, to get by.

Capitalism favors the majority, especially in rural areas. In urban areas, one do some stupid work, get by, live, and have time to do other things. But in rural areas, like can be much rougher, getting only enough to scrape by, not allowing the time to develop, take time to embark on larger projects, perhaps technologies, art, media, whatever. **Insitutions and the majority can only win by wasting the time of the minority on institutionalized work.** Evenually though, the minority will win.

But when that minority wins, gets capital, will they save those that suffer in developing countries, rural areas, slaves, run-aways, homeless peoples? Do they even know? Are the conscious? Then, do they know how to help these peoples? How many do? Almost none of them.

**Awareness must constantly be brought to their minds, and a place with the proper education on how must be provided.**
