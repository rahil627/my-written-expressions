Skimming through The Politics Book by DK Publishing, I notice my attention is focused on something it has been recently: rationality, and, more importantly, its opposite.

In the book, there are a few chapters that seem to have a rational or anti-rational sentiment: rational politics and parliamentary government do not belong to the same system, it is the myth that is alone important, the will to power, if the end justifies the means what justifies the end?, etc. Most, save 'the will to power', are against rationality. Oakeshott's article calls a sort of reasoned, theoretical politics 'rational politics' (regimes of the 1900s) and simply argues and desires for a pragmatic, every-day experienced governance. I didn't read the other articles, as this was enough to provoke this old thought:

**What is rationality?** Some sort of reasoned action, with some sort of desired end. For example: I was motivated to make art that displayed the effects of capitalism. I was compelled to make the art because, well, mostly because I wanted to [out of feeling], but perhaps also because I wanted to criticize capitalism and human behavior within capitalism; Criticize society, in order to improve it. Hmmm. Maybe not the best example. Another example: I created the Humans of Taiwan project, partly because I simply was curious of talking to the public, but also partly because I wanted to capture some beautiful minds of Taiwan's culture, so that people who saw the project would focus their attention on the beauty of people, of their diversity (of mind). That was my rationality. Creating art was my reasoned action. The end was to educate viewers by showing them the public, raw, as opposed to some narrow-cultured selection by media.

Then, **what's the opposite of rationality?** It's not irrationality. It's something else. It feels as if the opposite is characteristic of the word feminine. Perhaps passivity? No, **it's natural**. The opposite of rationality is natural. Rational actions are based on reason. Natural actions are based on nature.

**Then, what is nature, natural? It is natural to care. It is natural to survive. It is natural to organize, for care and survival. Nature is feeling.**

Isn't rationality based on an individual's organization? How does that differ from natural organization? [todo: answer]

Is it natural to organize others though? Rational politics organize others, and that's the problem. No one should organize another person's life [according to their rationality].

How does a rational person act? A rational person may wake up, go to work, do some chores, get enterained, sleep. The rationality is to work in order to obtain money, in order to do whatever one pleases with that money after work.

**How does a natural person act? A natural person wakes up whenever the body feels so, acts upon the body's surroundings, making decisions actively throughout the day, at every moment, perhaps to cook some food, care for an animal, care for material possessions, care for recycling, care for neighbors, care for other's businesses and materials, care for others' rationalities, care for others that care, care for others that care for the said natural person.**

**The rational person acts toward a rational end. The natural person is constantly reacting to their environment. Rational people act. Natural people react.**

**Reaction derives from a feeling perceived. Rational action derives from a reason.** Taking a stray cat home is likely a reaction to an experience with the stray cat. Working at an animal sanctuary, every-day, from morning to night, is more likely from reasoning. One doesn't experience and react to stray animals every morning, then feel compelled to take care of them at a sanctuary.

[todo: keep going! next thought was that it's un-natural to go to work, or another location, everyday. **It's natural to simply take care of the things around you.**]

[todo: categorize these writings as 'Towards Natural Behavior']
