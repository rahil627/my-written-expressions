Sunset island, much like the suburbs, is a lifeless place. Nobody comes to make art, create communes, express passions. Just a bunch of dead passer-byers.

Where are those people?

Well, you have to create a place that encourages expressing passions: open-mics, comfortable spaces, hanging out. Or, the city.

A city itself is motivating enough. The people, the environment. It’s all together. Everyone living together, like one big home, with the desires to make it better.

The suburbs doesn’t work like that. There’s no places to busk because everyone drives personal transportation. There are no shared places. Everything is either home or business, the property of some owner.

Tainan is much like that too. It’s either home or business. Nothing in-between. Nothing shared. The shared parts: the roads, nature, are all treated like trash. Even the people treat others like trash! There is only care for ones own property, including one’s own kin.

**The city encourages more cooperative behavior the same way a home does. Take care of public places, whether it’s a kitchen or a public bus, because they are shared. It’s the sharing that encourages more care and cooperation.**

**So, by increasing the amount of things that are shared or public, the amount of care and cooperation increases.**

**Theoretically...** A good culture is necessary too. Making a public place in a bad culture will just result in lots of assholes trashing the place.

The city is full of places that encourages expressing passions: event spaces and events everywhere, mingling.

It’s a place there encourages interaction, whether in the public or event spaces.

The rest of the world, in comparison, is either dead or in cliques.

A communal place acts as a city environment, encouraging interaction, encouraging passionate expressions, and, by sharing things, encouraging care and cooperation too.

The city, by virtue of living so close to each other and simultaneously to one’s own home, allows one to maintain a state of calmness while still being in a very active and public environment. One can have tea at home, bring some snacks, walk around the city neighborhood, interact with millions of people. This is impossible elsewhere.

In non-city areas, one has to plan to go out, plan to just interact! It’s unnatural...Calling just to visit, as opposed to just wandering and showing up. Ew.

**Just keep a communal place open. No events. Anyone can hang out at any-time.** That’s the best. It’s more natural than events, which, has people running in for a limited time, then, running out. **An always open communal place is far more homely than an event space.** **The main event is hanging out. More events develop naturally from just hanging out. No need to organize events.**

No need for music shows, open-mics, etc. timed performances. Just, “Hey! You feel like jamming? Let’s play at the park.” The feeling comes naturally, during that moment in time.

**Everything comes from the interaction within public communal spaces. Consensual actions.** From there, anything is possible.

Although communal spaces should be public, completely inclusive, I feel it is a waste of time to have tourists merely visit. In the case of cities, yuppies too. They just consume. They don’t seem to get anything out of it. It’s just an exhibit, a picture to them. They never participate. Furthermore, they’re not caring or careful, especially Taiwanese Chinese tourists. Ugh. So, **keep it public, but, not in the tourists’ view.**

It should really just attract participatory people. People that want to do things together. People that want to live together, make a home.

**That’s what the ad should say. Let’s build a hang-out spot together.** Put it on Facebook. Put a physical sign just out-side. Put another sign at AhLiang’s hut. Write: After you are done watching the sunset on sunset island, come hang-out, eat, drink, share, work, play, build, together, at the shack behind the fishing shop.

Hmmm, I think I need some lighting first, wi-fi?, music!, hot water / tea, electricity? Mosquito spray. A comfy couch facing the coconut trees, and fire. Warmth during the winter. Mosquito netting at the entrances. New doors? Tatami and yellow lights? Remove the flooring and wall-paper, then, have people draw (with chalk!) on the floors and walls! Graffiti or paint on the out-side? Outdoor chairs. Outdoor work-space (facing the trees and moon)! Fire-pit (on the grass in front) for heat every night, anti-mosquito, cooking (sweet potatoes and graham crackers! learn how to cook on the fire for cheap night snacks.). Pitch the tent on the beach for moon-light beach work-space; Just keep it pitched! Then, perhaps, get some people to join.

I can also throw some signs at cool places, that have an anarchic vibe to it, like the Factory or Place of Arts did.

Free tea and buttered toast would be cool. Pancakes / waffles later on. Fruit. Cheap indie farmer veggies. Coconuts? Lots to share.

Hot water dispenser for the winter at the bamboo hut would be cool. Keep sipping. Provide cheap tea bags and sugar.
