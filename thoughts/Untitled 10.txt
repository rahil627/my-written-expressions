Still feel great. Saturday. The church didn’t give food because I didn’t get there on time, but the bhuddist place did.

The only day I feel like looking for work at the log, a festival beside it takes place!...

Thiinking about how it’s come to this: how my life has come to this. Much like *Into the Wild* (the film), it’s a search, a search for a place, a culture, an environment that’s right. What’s right is difficult to describe; It’s a lot of things. It’s difficult to rationalize. But...

It’s s place where one can grow, freely, at one’s own pace.

A *natural* place? A *real* culture? What the difference between these two word-concepts, for me?

Natural means a place where people can naturally find their own bearings in a natural way, much like a child in a new environment. The child wanders, finds or creates a home, adjusts, create’s one’s own routine, plays, lives. It’s finding one’s own place in the world, but in a very natural way, without external forces, including authorities such as institutionalized education via school or bad parenting.

Real means a culture, a set of behaviors, that maintains *being real*. It maintains *realness* by calling out *fake* people, even ridiculing them through jokes, avoiding *fake cultures*, excluding fake people... Through comedy of the institutionalized... What’s being real, really though? And how does that differ from being natural?

Real...is a trait of a culture. Some cultures have it, some don’t. Within a real culture, being real is the norm, the normative behavior. Being fake is being something beyond that norm. A person beyond that norm can be ostracized, becoming outcasts: hippies, even, taking on the term *black hippy* or simply, *OutKasts*.. In this particular case, ***Black culture* is a real culture**, but, there are normative limits. Thus, it seems, keeping it real, can conflict with being deviant to that culture. So, where does *keeping it real* exists, purely, without conflict to growth of self, growth of individual mind, growth of culture? Or, is real always in risk of conflict [with deviance]? Or, is real simply what holds a culture together, mainting a set of behaviors of that culture?

I feel, that it’s a cultural trait, that several vastly different cultures, say, Black American and Aboriginal Taiwanese cultures, can both be real. If you use an institutionalized dialect, say, sounding like a person from Beijing, or, a Taiwanese news reporter, you will get joked. So, it’s not culture dependent...

But, when an individual crosses the boundaries of the norms, say, simply wearing clothes that are deviant, is the person considered not being real? When Andre3000 wears colorful hippie clothing is he not being real? Nah, he’s just stretching the boundaries of what can be included in the culture. He’s still black culture. Incredibly so. Even more so than most Black Americans! He has a huge southern vibe to him...

Then...?

It takes as bit of education to see the difference between being culturally deviant and fake. Nearly everything is allowed in black culture: flamboyant gay males, people into really white cultures (*white music*, *fine arts*, etc.). Those things don’t conflict with being real. Being fake has something more to do with *not being yourself*, not being you, acting quite differently based on the cultures, institutions, and sets of behaviors of others. Being a flamboyant gay male is something that comes from within. It’s not something that comes from others. Having manners, being overtly nice and polite [like a waiter / waittress], talking in a way people often do with their superiors / authorities, are things that come from elsewhere. That elsewhere seems to be tied to those with more power, not only that, but abuse power.

**Sharing is the norm or natural communities.** Paying others for services is not. **Services are only natural when they are given, like a gift.** People who pay for things, without regard to the culture, the behaviors of that culture, are considered being inconsiderate. They are not being real. They are being assholes.

**Being real is the same as being one’s self when one is with their family and/or friends. It’s a natural behavior, where-in one can laugh out loud, hard, rolling, without a care in the world. It’s being playful. It’s being able to be playful.
**

**Being real is about not giving a fuck what others think, and just doing you.** **If one must consider what someone else thinks, an authority, or even, just a more politically correct mind, then one is being less real.** Hence, the east coast and south being more real than the west coast of America (SoCal is exceptional). Hence Chinese and East Asian cultures being very fake. **These cultures overtly consider the lives of others, and in doing so, they sacrifice what it is to be themselves, to be real.**

But, then, isn’t there a balance of being considerate and of being real / inconsiderate? Japanese culture is completely inconsiderate *and* fake. Taiwanese-Chinese culture is considerate yet are fake, unable to even create their own identity, unsure of what to do in life, much like real hippies in America. East coast lower to middle-class sub-urban cultures are often real yet inconsiderate; Hence that sub-urban don’t care about your neighbors or others feeling, and, being completely oblivious to the problems of development (environmental ethics, etc.). So, where does the balance lie?

**One must be considerate of others, taking care of those around, yet, inconsiderate, in that one has one’s own desires and passions. It’s being able to to care for others, yet, do you.** One must split the time between both. Doing one or the other leads to imbalance, extremes, the flaws of many cultures...By considering others, we learn about others’ personalities, minds, cultures, etc. By being inconsiderate, we learn about ourselves, our personality, our mind, our building own cultures, chasing our own desires and passions....**By being too considerate we lose ourselves. By being too inconsiderate we lose others.** By being too considerate, we take on a more *female* set of behaviors: We base our lives on others, dependent, passively fitting our natural flow within the flows of other groups of people.  By being too inconsiderate we take on a more *male* set of behaviors: We do what we want to, more egotistic, using or abusing rationality over consideration, organizing the world according to our own desires, being oblivious to the desires of others.
