Clan vs psuedo-Egalitarian ethics

Some cultures prefer tight groups of friends, such as the east coast and southern areas of America, often healthier suburban neighorhoods of America too. It’s also obvious in Black American, Hispanic, Filipino, Indonesian, some South-Asian cultures, and surely several more.

Some cultures seem to be more shallow, fake, and generally fake-friendly toward anyone, with fake-consideration to others, exhibited through gifting or shallow conversation (introductions), such as the west coast of America, above LA. It’s obvious in yuppies and Chinese or Chinese-like cultures.

The mind behaves differently in both cultures:

In the *clan culture*, people are pretty chill. Do work. Play. Hang-out.

In the frontin’ culture, people can be a bit more conscious of the moment: the people around, their own ethics, other people’s ethics, looking at the world from an observer point of view, like a curious traveler that never touches, that never lives. Thus, people within this culture never actually lives. Instead of hangin’ out, they’re wandering the world, observing, adding more data, more political-correctness, more morals, but doing less and less. The end is a simple life of survival: selling food or tea on the street, much like Taiwanese culture does.

In a clan, one plays, loves (familial).

Alone in the world, one looks at others on how to behave, mimicking others. Behavior doesn’t come naturally, spontaneously, from within. It’s a strange rationality. Almost nothing happens truly naturally. The behavior which is so common to families and friends within clans does not exist: no one is playing or chillin’. Instead, people claw at each other to reach the top of the ethical pyramid. Conscious people constantly judging as they live and do.

With that said, it may seem the clan is better, but it’s not so.

The clan culture suffers from being unconisous, doing nothing, perhaps playing sports, video games, ‘playing hard’, partying. These things, according to moral, can be between a waste of time to terrible consumerism within the capitalist system. **‘Work hard, play hard’, that is, work at some institutionalized place, then play hard via consumerism.** Nearly nothing is good about it in this light.

**The *fake hippy culture* consumes more carefully, lives more carefully, working and playing all more carefully too.** There’s a bit more consciousness in everything.

Yet, the results as a whole, the holistic results, seem to favor the clans. Loyalty, *real culture*, real life, no passive aggressiveness, true friends and family.

It’s a strange contradiction. **By trying to be a better person, do good, live a good life, we contradictorily become bad friends.** **We sacrifice close relationships for good ethics.** **We become better hippies and/or anarchists, but cut our relations.**

But isn’t that the only way?

The institutions, traditions (of old and contemporary cultures), habits hold the majority down, precisely where they are. Only a few personalities often truly break out or escape of those things. And even less can leave their past relations. The true way is exactly what I admire about Kendrick: he stays at home, in Compton, loyal, progressing within, but still physically located at home.

That tough. Really tough. When your surrounding world is full of development (roads, industrially-built buildings, corporations, etc.), it’s difficult to maintain a state of grace. Further: paying for property via rent, needing a car, not being able to live in a simple abode, bureaucracies...

Perhaps the best way is still to simply move everyone out to a good place: nature.

**Only in nature, away from institutions, *traditions with authority*, can people grow well,** un-corrupted, un-forced, un-ill-educated.

How else could it be?

**I mean, in-side America, how else would one avoid public schooling or even public-schooled people? The whole country is institutionalized. Mass media just maintains it.**

**When the entirety of a culture is institutionalized, when most of the arts and media are also conform to the *ideology of the institutions* (I always forget the term for this...), how is it even possible for one to grow up naturally?** 1984, again.

**Nature is a far better place (than ‘developed’ places) to grow up because there is a far greater chance of people growing up with more natural and less corrupted minds.** Only a few personalities naturally ignore the traditions of the ‘developed world’. Only they develop their minds attune to a more natural accord. The rest (of the personalities) will fall prey to the insitutions.

Both cultures, clan culture and fake hippy culture would be better in nature. Clan culture wouldn’t suffer from consumerism or over-working; Hippy culture would still probably be finding more ways to better themselves, but, hopefully, happier than the current state of the world, as the clan culture in nature wouldn’t be *that* bad!

**The clan culture lives. The hippy culture tries to live right.** That is the easiest division of personalities and of society. The sheep and the idealists. How do we get along?

Having power-hungry people with the most power (capital) surely is not the right way...

A simple distribution of power?

How do we get along?

**Let the sheep live sheeply. Let the idealists live ideally. Separately? One as life-long wage-slaves; The other as life-long commune-dwellers.** The commune-dwellers may have to be a wage-slave for a moment, until they figure out a good way to consistently obtain wealth.

For the most part, we live together. The idealists as part-time or temporary workers, or artists, in every part of the world. But, eventually, the environment and culture just isn’t as ideal as it can be. And so, the idealist breaks away, in search of environments and cultures with better values and morals, moving from suburb to city, city to nature and educational institution to city artist institution to self-organized communities.

Or, the idealist self-organizes a community where-ever they are. It depends on how bad the native culture and environment is. Some-times moving out is actually the right thing to do. **Cultures steeped in tradition are best left to die off.** **Only conscious people are worth worrying about; Worrying about robots and traditional minds seems a waste.** Of course, it’s not. They are humans. They shouldn’t be robots or traditional wage-slaves, but, fighting against a majority of them, millions of them... that’s something else.

They have to be saved later. First, one must build a good environment and culture. Educating others comes later. Educating by force is necessary, especially for the sheep (robots and traditional-minded slaves), but, perhaps, that would happen last, as they are the hardest to *change*.

**It is by having the sheep enter a good culture / environment that they change, not the other way around: changing people in a bad culture / environment; because, the bad culture / environment is the root cause of all the problems.** The institutions (property, law, etc.) and traditions are within the culture / environment. **It is much easier to start from scratch, than to systematically carefully eliminate all of the problems (insitutions, stereo-typing / -isms).** The bad developments of societies are hard to near impossible to get rid of, thus, it is best to get out of it.

Knowing the origins of institutions, including capitalism, doesn’t help or change anything. It’s getting out of places with bad insitutions that changes everything.

It could happen at home, with a family, with peers in a communal place, but, **eventually, one runs into institutions: transportation, property, food, water. One can’t even survive simply without dealing with institutions.** Everything must be re-built, from scratch.

One can even do nearly everything themselves: catch rain-water, ask farmers for un-sellable yields, live out-side of property, use second-hand bicycles [It doesn’t have to be so extreme. One can still rely on water and electric companies, and even good food systems (such as ones near farms)]... So, it doesn’t even require a whole culture / environment: a single person can do it all: live self-sufficiently. That *is* the beginning of a culture / environment. That is **the way:**

**Live self-sufficiently. Allow others to join. Later, teach others the way.**
