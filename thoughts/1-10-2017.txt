Sunday. No people at the park; Too hot. No need to eat; Restaurant closed. No need to do anything; It’s been so long since I’ve done things to a natural accord.

The beach is calm, shallow to a great distance: a rainbow of depths. Seasons matter, as during typhoon season there were nasty waves everyday. Now, it seems artificial it’s so perfect.

It really is about placing yourself in the right places, if one is susceptible to the cultures of others. Being in a bland town and a good city neighborhood are two different worlds, state of minds. Some people are able to live and do things on their own, without others. Some are able to use digital technology to talk and use video to socialize. Not me. I need people, next to me.

At this point the only homes are the anarchic communities. Hostels are businesses, not a communal ventures. Apartments are a pain to get, often temporary, though, important in urban placement. It begins with the anarchic community. Then, a car. Then, start another community. That’s the only way. (The only way to place yourself in the right places.)
