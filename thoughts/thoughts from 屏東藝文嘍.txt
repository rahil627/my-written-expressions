a thought from this morning:
Public libraries are the only useful part of government. They, like many other free, public places, are an asylum from the crazy world.

Laws, enforcement (of laws), executive decision-making, are all useless ideas; Only the public library serves as a model of a good place. The public library system, if managed by the right people, like good public places, have the potential to be great places, influencing many great minds, or great minds to-be.

If public libraries weren't limited by rules (laws), they could be transformed into amazing places, dependent on the people that run it, which depend on the people that live in the area. Each library could represent each area -- neighborhood, town, county. Each library would have it's own culture.

Limits to modern libraries are: no talking, dress code, and limits to management. If libraries were handled as public places, many Asian hostels, or, homes -- Yes: If libraries were managed as if they were their own home, or studio, they would be amazing places.

/
Libraries could have events, but they must be free, donations only. Street performers can wander libraries as their venues, just as they do train stations, parks, and specific venues (music venue, fine art venue, etc.).

/
Libraries are an inclusive place for people of any interest. The limit of creative places is that they often limit what comes into the place with a certain direction. For example, hacker-spaces, fab-labs, specific media-oriented places, academic departments. Everyone can go to the library and socialize with anyone: homeless people, tech / "professional" workers, labor workers, home-makers, etc.

Already, at the first scene, the family moving all of their belongings haphazardly on a typical blue farmer truck is an amazing one. To be free, not too attached to belongings. Later, the guy writes stuff for work, exchanging info anyway(, so the [physical] belongings don't matter too much).

A letter to Studio Ghibli:
To Studio Ghibli, especially Takahata.

[written after re-watching My Neighbor Totoro]

Over the past few months while living in an artist commune in 屏東， 台灣, [During that time, ]I've watched several animated films by Studio Ghibli, Keichi, Hosoda, Shinkai, and whoever made A Letter to Momo.

For the past 8[?] years I've lived in various places, and traveled many parts of the world, leading my state of mind to go from contemplative films to designing games for change [people's behavior], public spaces, urban planning, anti-capitalism, human geography, philosophy, idea-generating, creating technology (/ tools) to enable more civic actions, creating technology (/ tools) to alter behavior to be more natural; from traveling cheaply to being homeless; and now, finally, back to a childish, natural way of living: obtaining a little capital without thinking too much why, and creating a home using only natural materials.

While living in this place, filled with people who are a mix of spiritual and natural, many of whom politic via various arts for society to be[have] more natural -- being vegetarian, riding bicycles, etc. -- I've resisted the socio-cultural reality of much of the worlds' minds and have been following some natural ideal ways of living (ethics) that are not too far from the rural ideals depicted in those Japanese animated films.

I've nearly transformed over time from a capital-oriented person whom tried to influence the world around me at *every* moment of time and space I've lived in, whom tried to figure out why humans behave the way they do through comparing societies I've experiencing living in, to a rather traditional person: farming [for a moment, until realizing one become's a slave to plants, and that foraging or living off of excess is better], cooking, taking care of a home, taking care of the devices in it, taking care of my personal transportation vehicles, and taking care of the people in it. This radically opposes my mind before, which was to take care of a neighborhood, city, or even, the world, through various means -- mostly, through the generation of ideas, spreading of ideas, and technology to facilitate both.

It's been a really slow alteration of my mind, to block out the world. Perhaps the ideals depicted in the films are wrong. Perhaps we should be saints in developing nations ensuring the world has the basic human needs (water, food, shelter). Perhaps we should be politicking with stupid people to stop the uneven development and proliferation of stupidity from rampant capitalists. Despite such strong desires toward all those political desires for so many years, I think I've finally gotten a taste of harmony of a simpler life: buying [or harvesting or finding low-quality, un-sellable] fresh vegetables, cooking large portions for several people, storing cooked food in the fridge, working part-time at nearby good[-valued] businesses, perhaps doing some stupid work for capitalists for higher wage at times.

Though I do not think farming is the way to go [organic farming is a really difficult life not worth doing as so much food is already produced, and as there are probably more natural methods to farm], as depicted in many films, having a dwelling in or near nature with a fridge, a fan (for tropical weather), compost system (throw in nature), and citronella plants (to fend off mosquitos) surely is a good start toward freedom. Not depicted in the films is selling commodities via independent stalls in a public place, such as a park or day / night markets (for Taiwan). Perhaps money is not shown in *any* of the films -- an interesting choice. Neither are computers or media depicted, as a method to obtain information -- only books, teachers, and parents are. Which is strange, as they *are* animated films.

Also, unfortunately, schools are normalized and depicted in many of the films. A huge exception being Wolf Children, of which, the child at a very young age decides to not attend on his own, and go out into the world on his own, like his father, learning from direct reality. Perhaps Whisper of the Heart also showed this to a lesser extent, allowing the children to choose to forge their own paths. No forms of home school, self-learning, or alternate educations are depicted.

Anyway, that's getting off-topic, sorry.

I'm just glad, so glad such films exist. I've watched a few (Miyazaki and Takahata; Though Hirokazu Koreeda being my favorite) during my late high school, early college Netflix years, living with my parents in a suburb in America, but the reality of the ideas in the films didn't sink in until 10 years later, after several stays in various parts of Taiwan, always coming back, finally realizing it was the nature of Taiwan reeling me in (along with all the other great cultural perks of this country) all along.

It feels as if I've chased those lovely vegetable-sellers from my hometown's East Asian markets to Chinatowns in Brooklyn, New York and San Francisco to the day markets in Taipei, Taiwan to the farms in Taiwan, to tribal villages at the entrances of rivers that cut through mountains. In another way, it feels as if I've chased my mother's traditional way of living: cooking at home, buying vegetables, taking care of everything.

These films may have been some kind of spiritual guidance in the back of my head. Totoro (and most of the films' settings) incepted traditional and rural ideals early on, as it always reminded me of the area I grew up in, jumping ditches, chasing tadpoles, riding bikes, and eating at home. Memories Drip-drop (Only Yesterday) gleaned knowledge and reality of rural areas and life (clearly showing Takahata's awareness), displayed a possible example of the reality of socialization from city to rural area via that amazing ending, and depicted the harking / calling of a more natural life through memories. Wolf Children mastered much of the above, adding a method to make it all a reality, whilst praising the lone wolf education / lifestyle. The Red Turtle, along with the beginning of Princess Kaguya, may have depicted the most natural way of living. All of the films serve as models of good human behavior.

For the past few days it's been quite hot. Time has been passing by slower. I've been harvesting small-sized tomatoes and basil from the garden to eat with bread. I now have one of those old Honda Cub like scooters that farmers usually have, along with my bicycle and the public bicycle system. The commune I live in is about to close down as the church claims the property back, and many of us will soon be moving closer to nature.

Today, I had a mockingly good conversation with two friends about finding ways to bring nature back into urbanized areas: guerrilla planting nuisance plants in public areas (poisonous, smelly, thorny, grow beneath concrete, ruin car paint, clean the polluted air, etc.) and attracting nuisance animals (raccoons, geese, mountain goats, monkeys, skunks, etc.). We imagined people being hilariously harassed by the animals at a nearby park, and mimicked the frightening noises those animals make.

Perhaps after all this talk I'm still thinking politically, but at least the method is more natural. :)

Thanks.

links to older thoughts during viewings of films over my life-time.

My Neighbor Totoro (cont.):
LOL, the kids are wildly annoying without any sort of rules.

Cooking vegetables, a staple of Ghibli. Bok choy it seems.

Inside the kitchen is a hand-pump to get water.

The older sister, Satsuki, is so full of energy, finding friends. There's no problem at all. Where did they come from? The city? Another rural area? Don't they miss their past friends?

Oh, but their mother is in a nearby hospital. Perhaps just a different neighborhood?

Rice fields, clear air, and a large house. The dream?

"Otasan, you be the flower shop." A natural business idea.

Tadpoles. College Park used to have them too. And they were indeed cool.

As kids, we wonder into the forest until we are tired, and sleep there.

This father is perfect.

Awwww, the little sister reminds me of me. I used to cry a bit too, if I didn't get what I wanted.

These kind of shrines still do exist near farms, in Japan and in Taiwan.

I used to run with joy too.

LOL. The male is quite like me too, lying about certain silly things, to hide a simple reason.

Hmmm but the older sisters sees the Totoro and Cat-bus too. Did the belief spread? Ecstasy from rural pleasure?

There's this kind of spiritual aspect to the innocent childhood happiness, as they ritually sprout a forest.

Mei, being more childish, follows the Totoro's culture, immediately, intuitively hopping on to the Totoro. Satsuki takes a moment, then joins.

Lol. It turns out the Totoros just have a woodwind instrument to make sounds.

The plants actually sprout.

The wind bell chimes.

The grandmother has farming knowledge: plant growth, temperature, time of harvest.

(...climax)

From the expression of the people passing by, where she came from, Matsugo, is quite far.

The world is so small in the climactic landscape scenes. One can see the entire rural area by simply climbing a small hill.

The grandmother and perhaps some other grandmother really are spiritual, traditional people. The main family is not frightened. Instead, they perhaps believe in that kind of spirituality. The grandmother prays for Mei to come back safely.

Ahh she hops a ditch without shoes. So nostolgic.

Satsuki asks Totoro for help. It calls Neko-basu to take her to Mei. They forgive each other. Then they observe their mother at their hospital, whilst perched on a tree, seeing that she is fine.

A spiritual journey for Satsuki. They bring her a corn because the grandmother told them vegetables will help her health. All is well. Satsuki overcomes her great worry: her mother's death; and the other great worry: her sister being lost. Perhaps the lesson is to worry less?

In the ending images, there's another baby, of which Mei looks over.

There's an image of them wear clothing with a stitched white dustbunny, or small-sized Totoro. I think I spotted some fabric in the film with it too. Even their classmate has overalls with one too.

There's an image of them carrying a large steel teapot, a basket, perhaps with freshly baked food, and another basket, perhaps with washed vegetables.

They make a bonfire to cook sweet potatoes.

Mei draws a Neko-basu with chalk.

The grandmother passes down traditional knowledge.

They read the picture-book with their mother from which the idea of Totoro is derived.

An image of Neko-basu. Perhaps symbolizing the journey.

My Neighbor Totoro:
Strange intro. I don't remember this film at all... Though, a good preparation for a film: music, time.

Already, rural landscapes pass by from an open window. Ahhhh, that rural ideal, that rural love.

Off the main road, beyond a patch of rice fields: their house, with ecstatic kids in love with nature.

LOL. The kids are wildly joyful.

The house reminds me of the one in Wolf Children. Sliding shutters, all open, glass behind, all wood. Beautiful. Rotten, but beautiful. They even have a well!

Ahhhh, the joy of renovating a home.

Miyazaki depicts rural life as a joy. Yet, it's social life and convenience that's often a joy for city goers. Not cleaning, cooking, and labor.

In no time, the house is livable.

Though the people that live in the area, the kid, his parents, and his grandmother are quite cooky feeling, it's not quite the same in reality, where the people lack that kind of charm. Rural people can be mean, off-putting, independent, unhelpful.

Rattan baskets, steel pots, wooden utensils fill the kitchen. Wonderful. With the well, a wood-fire stove seals the rural wooden cabin ideal.

Smiles and laughs to keep the kids happy and alive.

They hand--foot-wash their clothes with joy.

And then they bike off.

That freedom, to bike around the fields, is such a great one. It's everything I loved about my childhood. Biking around, safely, without traffic, people, non-sense, businesses, etc. Though it can be done with a good state of mind, that childhood state of mind is difficult to return to, now, with the world to think about.

The Red Turtle, a quick analyses.

What was the intention of the director(s)? Here, though the director is some French person, I feel I am battling with Isao Takahata's ideals again.

This time, it isn't some rural ideal. It's absolute nature. An island of nature, alone, isolated from everything.

It feels like an explorative game (Prince of Persia) than a film, as we don't know what the protagonist is thinking about, as his mind isn't displayed via language: the film has no dialogue. Instead, we only see his actions, which are geared toward survival, and getting off of the island.

But he can't get out. It's normal (natural?) to desire to go back to the civilized world, to one's social relations. Instead, the protagonist, after spending much bodily effort building rafts, hits an impasse: the red turtle. Perhaps some symbolism here. Thus, he is forced to live on the island, naturally.


-
All of the actions in the film are quite natural. To kneel down and drink water. To walk barefoot. To instinctively grab an edged bamboo at the sound of danger. **The film is an animation of natural human behavior.**

In Princess Kaguya, the protagonist is born in nature, then thrown into royalty, with it's manners and such, then decides to go back to nature. Here, we get to see an extension of the first part of the film: the natural life.

In so many of Ghibli's films, they depict cities and use rural areas as an ideal, but Takahata goes beyond, with natural areas as an ideal. Here, the protagonist is foraging food, using found objects. There are no tools, or building a house, or artificial structures to make life more convenient. Somehow, the protagonist looks quite comfortable. Perhaps the weather is somehow perfect?

[watching and thinking]

In the near beginning the guy (protagonist) falls into a grotto. Even before seeing that the son makes the same mistake, it feels like a rite of passage to live on the island. If one cannot survive, one will not survive in nature. The desire to survive is there. He hasn't given up. Perhaps he feels he must survive, for his social relations.

After nearly dying, he finds that the stray barrel in the ocean is empty. Perhaps a lesson to desire nothing.

Turtles are born, and go out to sea.

The moon and stars are clearly visible.

His desire is shown in a dream, of a wooden bridge. He flies off the island, perhaps a Ghibli signature.

A crab grabs a turtle that washed up to the shore.

He builds a raft.

He gives a piece of food to the crabs. Learning to take care of life. The crabs, depicted as a cute, humorous society of their own.

He sails out, but fails.

He builds bigger, and fails harder. Perhaps some anti-technology, anti-control of nature / fate message?

A centipede goes over his foot. An omen?

A crab grabs a washed-up dead fish.

This is feeling buddhist.

Ants. A bat.

Musicians from some past time play music.

A desire of people, music, organization?

He drinks water like a water buffalo now.

A dead sea lion.

On his third rafting attempt, the crabs join him, but he shoos them off. The crabs care for him. But he still quite doesn't care for nature.

Here, he faces the red turtle. Loses. The red turtle looks him in his eyes. He curls up into a ball, frightened by the power of nature, submitting to it. Still unhappy that he cannot have what he desires: to be home.

The red turtle comes up shore. His hits it on the head with a bamboo, then overturns it.

He continues building his fourth raft. Getting quite adapt at living naturally, now hunting fish with a bamboo spear.

Seeing the dead turtle everyday, he builds a care for it. His feelings shown again in black and white, reaching for the turtle as it levitates toward the sky (heaven). He regrets it. Tries to save it by splashing some water on it.

Later, the shell cracks open. A women appears in the place of the turtle. His altered mind, his newly-found care for nature, transforms the turtle into a beautiful woman.

He takes care of her by building house-like shade trellis over her. Contradictorily, the raindrop wakes her up. Perhaps, a message that there is no need to build a house. Nature is the house.

The man's ability to organize is capable of building a great raft, and a nice house, but the film seems to not care for any of it. They are all useless artificial structures.

The woman disappears. Then reappears one moment, in the water, with only her head above. Strangely, his puts his shirt down, then runs into the bamboo forest. Why would manners matter here? A gift?

The woman sends her turtle shell off in a ritualistic manner. She has no choice: she must stay. The shell was her way to swim away.

The man follows, sending his unfinished raft.

The woman watches.

In water, they meet. Such natural movements. They play an animalistic mating game.

She eats an oyster / clam, then gives one to him. As he eats, he suddenly remembers hitting the red turtle on the head. Another message? Nature has treated us so well, offering us nourishment, yet when disaster strikes, we destroy it, to control it?

When his face shows sorrow, she consoles him. She gestures with a consoling closing of eyes and shift closer. She combs his face with his hand, bringing him back to reality. And then they go off, frolicking in the wild.

Two lines. Two shadows. The woman leads. The man follows her. He holds her hands. Love is created.

Saw The Red Turtle (La Tortoise Rouge?) a few days ago. Cleared my mind a bit. Relaxed me. I was able to become a slave to capital for a few hours for the two days after, doing (really menial) wage labor, cooking my own food, and so on.

Some thoughts over these past few days:
Perhaps from the Collapse documentary (from the book), or from working on the wax apple farm: Farms are poorly designed. The Western side of Taiwan is full of farms in an area that receives little to no rainfall. Land is allocated likely over generations of non-sensical trade of capital, farms are created on the land, some with quite old trees, cared for, in an entirely artificial way -- a grid of trees.

Perhaps from Sapiens, or my own thought from taking care of a roof garden: Farmers are slaves to plants. They must take care of them as they would domesticated pets. Water, everyday. Perhaps pruning. Protecting from rough weather. **Being nearby at least once per day;** Who wants to live in an isolated farming area, where the coolest performance is a student talent show?

Unfortunately, caring doesn't pay. Caring more or less does not matter. The market does not care for that. Once it gets to a developed country, it could turn into some industrialized food product, or perhaps a non-edible product. The market may decrease the price of the commodity, as some superior or alternative is found.

-

Packaging and transportation of food requires much energy, in the form of engine oil, gas, cardboard boxes, plastic (?) tape, and human labor. But the food must reach the city somehow, in good condition.

Then, it seems, local farms is the only way to go. Every neighborhood should be allocated a farm. The neighborhood must take care of it, and politic it.

But not all land is arable, or good, is it? Won't the land become over-farmed?

...doesn't all arguments end with the conclusion that we must live with nature? Meaning, in it.

Container plants? Roof and street gardens? River-side farming? Isn't that where all civilizations started, at some river delta?
-

Many daydreams of being a street musician, performing at the local park. Perhaps can live in nature, but go around city parks and train stations to perform, going in-between nature and the biggest city.

Can areas be organized into audio and video? Wander around an area, then organize it, then display / perform it at a public park: an outdoor exhibition. Donation box.

By placing the exhibition in the public, outside of a museum or any kind of space, it becomes public, as opposed to having a small, in-the-know crowd.

**Forget all kinds of organizations and organizers. Just use the park (or market). Vend, exhibit, perform at the park.**

Then, a **cart** becomes an important tool, to move objects (instruments, commodities) to the park.

[todo: play Cart Life with Apple and Kai2 Wei2]

Just dreamt of people from 藝文嘍 all vending, exhibiting, and performing with Isse at the train station. Aren with his pottery. Berta with her delicious lentil salad (50元/bowl). Me with tea, with a donation box that says "no cups, take and pay how much you like". A portable festival. A restaurant, tea shop. pottery shop, and concert all at once, along with the semi-natural setting of a park.

Park and train station hopping may be the best way to physically market. Having a cart, or a scooter with cargo, or a car, are all good ways to drag items along.

The cost of owning a property for a special need: restaurant, concert space, shop space are saved, in capital and urban space. (I've thought of mixed-use spaces, such as event-spaces, or even asking restaurant and shop-owners, to use their shop on their day off.) The trade-off is in being able to make everything portable, to bring to the park, and re-organize.

With postal services, using websites and internet marketplaces replace the vending model. The market becomes the world. One can industrialize the process of making (comfortably) at home. Media overcomes performances. Time and reality are lost. The seller / performer / maker becomes detached to their commodity. Humanity is lost.

Watched Ocean Waves. Not much feeling. Maybe a little at the ending, of desiring love, or of feeling lonely.

[todo: to blog]
Watched the beginning of When Marnie Was There. Again, rural feelings, but it seems so lonely, just as A Letter to Momo was, living at an aunt and uncle's home close to nature. It reminded me of 蘭嶼, with it's tiny harbor with an old burly man boating, and everyone knowing everyone. It also reminded me of 屏東藝文嘍, as a safe place for recovery.

The main character doesn't express facial emotions (blunted emotions), but thinks, very critically, with equally sharp humor, if any. There are pictures of her, younger, showing many facial emotions. It reminds me of me.

What was the reason for that? The bore of normal society? A lack of adventure after middle school? A loss of an adventurous place?

**"As long as she's having fun and eating well." That's a good measure of parenting.**

...

Marnie's house, with the strict nanny, evokes a restrictive feel, probably of many people's childhoods.

...

The family connections of mothers, foster mothers, grandmothers, are such strange powers.

Why did Marnie love her home, and be so determined to be happy, despite having such restrictive maids and a nanny? **She felt she was so lucky, compared to others (I also did as a child, and told many people many times). Also, she was quite free, to wander around the house, in nature (as was I).**

Why did Anna find it easy to make friends at the aunt's country town? Because they allowed her to do what she wanted; she too, was quite free there, undisturbed by the pestering society of schools and worrying parents...The manners of urban society are disregarded as she gets her festival clothes dirty. Punishments do not exist either, even when she told a school kid that she was a fat pig; The uncle even laughed at the situation. Though her aunt and uncle's chores (moving commodities, helping in the garden) and society's chores (cleaning the environment) are undesirable (a chore), using up one's time, **as long as she is free afterward, she feels at ease, making friends at her own pace, living at her own pace, recovering. Freedom is the cure.**

It seems that some children, perhaps influenced as being only-childs, prefer to be quite the hermit (lone wolf?) -- not having many or any friends, following their own desires, without much disturbance from society. The ending song fits that idea.
