## the answer and conclusion
You treat him the same way you would treat a short-tempered 4 year old: You restrain him and teach him how to talk and behave like a peaceful human being. Please send this child to time-out!

**Why did this “cop” not use proper restraint techniques? Why did the “cop” lack emotional awareness? Why was the “cop” so easily anxious? Why was the “cop” upset all night? Why is the “cop” unable to speak a whole sentence!?**

Because he’s not a cop. He lacks basic human experience and police training .

All fault goes to the people that allowed this uneducated, anxious, emotionally-unaware, child to become a cop: the police systems.

**Whats more dangerous than an easily-upset child in an adult body with a police uniform and a gun?**
