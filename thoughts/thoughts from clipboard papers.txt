#three papers written after witnessing the cheat

a paper [during time I came back to Backpacker’s Planet]:
Facebook message
- - -
old thought:
after day 3 morning

Felt shock. How can one fuck a traveler after having met for a few days?, especially after a past lover says “I thought about you every day”?

All feelings disappeared quickly and I was very happy to witness that, to shorten the time of requited love.

Then, soon after, I only felt worry, and glad that Baozi's family is there to take care of you — that’s what I told Baozi.

a few thoughts during my week after the hostel:
after seeing the messages (Friday):
**I wronged first. You were right.** You communicated that you missed me over a long period of time.
|
**This is a consistent fault of my personality.** I tend to do things specific, esoteric, for long periods of time — art (make games), philosophy (writings), social organizing, travel, living in different places / cultures, work, family. It’s very unbalanced, (socially) abnormal; yet I still choose it over relationships—to spend time on these things.
|
Maybe it’s a common problem of system-building-oriented, goal-oriented, work-oriented, American, artist, **society over personal relationship** minds.
  - “in my own world” — which is many worlds.
  - my goal / desire was simply to tell you I love you and ask you how you felt. Luckily,that goal was accomplished at McDonalds.
  / I live and I move on.

**I (still) only worry for any psychological damage I may have inflicted.** If you think anything can be done to lessen it, **tell [unable to read if tell, just guessing] me.**
/
I return your wish: physically and mentally.
  - If you need money to get yourself out of a bad situation, feel free to ask. (If I have any :) )
/
**Don’t worry about me.**
/
Since Taipei, and beginning the summer, I’ve been feeling […? cut off?]
/
I hope!
/
It’s finally time for my American ethics: just do it. Simple. Less thinking. Less aware.
  -> Independent. (art, design, technology).
/
I think we suffer from the same problem: we worry / care about others too much, but perhaps [word?] it’s emotionally better to care / love ourselves a little first.

ask if she wants to read my thoughts during the week at the hostel.

I thought / wrote this in English, then wrote it in [Chinese?] […?] communication errors.




another paper:
**her** and now:
- - -

[time: 斗六] Like or love? Love, but undecided how to live — school in Taipei / being broke / etc. / MIT / medical volunteer.
[time: 台南] Told Baibai, “maybe” have someone, not sure if together again.
[time: 臺北] Busy being poor / reading at library — societies through books, cleaning blog, researching headphones, etc.
[time: before 宜蘭] Thought about her often, perhaps every 1-2 days.
[time: 宜蘭] Ghost? First, want to talk, but she seemed busy / hiding. Then, suddenly okay. But **I still love her, undoubtedly.** The **same problems exist: my direction, my monetary problems, NY vs Taipei? Not so much choice of place anymore!** During my time in Taipei, I’ve let go of much relations with humans — cut from the world. Now, I’m independent again, as I was when I lived in American cities, and as a child ( - suburbs have no sense of place) — no dependencies. I will do what I want with less thought about others — society, education, problems of capitalism, etc. But I don’t think this childhood mode of life will last long; it was of my past to  think so simply. I don’t think I can ignore society’s problems for too long. Perhaps after just getting a little money I will be back [to] politicizing life.

For now — what to tell her?

First, what happened (above). Second, ask her what her plans are, how she feels as a human, for development ( - her future, Yilan, Taiwan, etc.) — making coffee and tie-dye okay?

Tell her she looks great, happy, so maybe going to a more developed place is not helpful. Maybe I’m just a crazy-working American.

Why did she still kiss?
  - body language?

convo 3:
she said she “respects” me, knows me
|
feel evil to not talk [ask? {about? during?}] douliu,
feel bad.
  - she said she forgives
convo 2. [nothing written? or she said she forgives?]
|
?
[probably forgot to continue writing]

her mind is fucking beautiful

**constant search for living**

convo1:
$experience of poor
$even lanyu has traces of the corruption of society.
go to Cali, use money
no care for money
$$look for **possible** ways to live.
  - coffee, crafts, etc.
(fight for freedom?)
no money / taken advantage
  - (I said)
“creative” - crafts, her own
(fight for life)

another paper:
[much older?]

list of major personal problems
- - - 

$$$ digital communication - **even just one minute per day**
  - is there any reason one can’t spend one minute to communicate? If the person is focused on other things; their attention is elsewhere.

$$$ use time selfishly - **only do and desire things on my time.**
  - this is a normal problem, everyone suffers from this, just to a different degree.

passive in romance - physically and communication.
  - what’s left? that’s all communication. Hmm. Too work-oriented.


My culture of love (close / real friends and family) would never (freely) have sex with a traveling customer (especially, within a week).

The next thought: I don’t want to think about how many customers. I’m very glad I saw that: it’s much much easier to let go.

I asked all I need to know, thanks for the time given to talk.

With the warm summer sun and music I feel that my mind is quite clear, body healthy, mood happy.

Thanks for the time together: many things experienced and learned, and hopefully can be improved during the trip around Taiwan.


[written sideways]
It was my mistake to like you. I tried to communicate to no avail.

[written on top write corner with a different writing tool]
robotic language too

[todo: to move to another text file]
Second Sophistic (cont.)
- - -
[written on top write corner]
for nations perhaps island sizes:
Sparta,
Taiwan,
Pacific islands,
small towns,
all eventually institutionalize a culture.
Ex: 
Japan,
Korea,
as extremes.

**I must go back in time, in the time of the development of societies.**

**interesting topics**
inclusion / exclusion
social organization
  - process
institutions
  - hegemony
communication
  - oral
  - written
  - visual
-

[todo: in drafts] write why academia is useless -> the conspicuous media consumption and area-bias of the academia
  - they travel time, and to do sot they use (highly) disrupted communications (written language), as opposed to simply living in societies
  - [on translations {todo: to blog post on translations?}] mention Harvard, Oxford, Cambridge presses, insular, Eurocentric, **because** they read instead of travel. It’s **the media problem** (existing media was written by written-culture societies, which limits to those societies that use human language, prefer writing over oral, and likely a Romantic language, due to translating ease.

It is up to multi-language Wikipedia to make up for these gaps in language. As for those that were oral, they will unfortunately be looked over. **I’m guessing it’s the oral societies, oral periods, where the most original thoughts were created; The most important philosophers did not write, they asked.**
  - now they probably tweet at the most
  - Socrates / Plato, Aristotle, Jesus[?], Cicero[?], Wittgenstein, Walter Benjamin, Chomsky
  - a history of oral societies
  - - the [greatest periods of time][romantic periods] weren’t written. ex. NY game scene[, Taipei, Taiwan {as a whole}]

$ write thoughts about film ideas
  - film essays: watching
  - - homeless person, narrating philosophy / critical theory [in audio], ends with me talking to the person to reveal the person is not homeless, thus showing social philosophy (especially urban) is meaningless [a contradiction]
  - - prototype one of each essayist style - Montaigne, Bacon (Calvino), etc.
  - - experiment with hidden knowledge — history, of material and people, playing with what the audience knows, revealing thing in the video

[romantic periods]: []
