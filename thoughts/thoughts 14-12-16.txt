After seeing the punk book, feel like performing. It had a page about how the owner of CGBG moved from West Village because of junior gangsters to East Village into a shit basement under The Palace, which had to be fumigated. Reminds me of Babycastles on Kent Ave. All it really requires is a space for people to commune. An empty space. No rules. No care. Do what you want. Do it yourself.

From the Practical Permaculture book, I recall the daydream of going home and organizing gardening projects. Then another daydream occurred, of going home to River Walk, and beginning permaculture work on the neighborhood and nearby neighborhoods with Shila-khaki. It connects s with people, creating good human experiences.

Banksy? Punk? Time to fight society again? Instead of being a recluse. I canâ€™t be a recluse, like Barrett. I need to talk to people, fight them.
