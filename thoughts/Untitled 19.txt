Philosophy and Human Values (again and again)

# 1
Excellence, Hedonism, Stoicism, Christianity (‘virtue ethics’)

Each set of ethics attached to their historical period of time:
normal, rise of an empire, fall of an empire, post-fall

Stoicism not too different, transitioning to Christianity

Excellence: can do everything well with moderation: like Odessius, an ‘all-arounder’, throw a spear, family man, argue and politic well, etc.

Hedonism: not over-consume, rather...? moderated hedonism?

Stoicism: rather extreme, whatever happens happens, you have to do whatever to survive (drought, wars, etc.), ‘buck up’, take it in, tolerate it, no choice

Christianity: whatever happens now gets translated to the after-life, adds fantastic reasoning for moral actions: you tolerate it now so that in the after-life there may be a better life, you just take what God gave you, still no choice, but less so because of extreme circumstances of life (poverty, war, etc.) and more so because of simply not thinking

Dark Ages not so bad, more equal than previous empires, just more normal and natural life really, much like life in developing countries, so, even more equal than the current structure of the world

# 2
Kant and Utilitarianism

Skip 2000 years to the Enlightenment and French Revolution. A period full of rationalization, more precise, more bureaucratic (Weber, a good social thinker and critic of this type of thinking), precise statements and arguments instead of more larger and vague ‘just generally live this way’ or ideals type of thinking of the Greek and Roman ethics. The pro is getting more exact to what is right and wrong, the con is that it doesn’t account for the complexity of reality. For example, one day one might just be tired or have a toothache and may not feel like talking that day, breaking many categorical imperative made laws. Or, one may have a personality that just happens to be less consistent. There’s no way for the (Enlightenment) ideas to apply for such simple situations as these.

Categorical imperative: a command, not just a suggestion, that you will (act) in a way that  could create a universal law on it, every action you take can is an action that you would allow anyone and everyone else to take

Kingdom of Ends: if everyone followed the categorical imperative, it would create an end of society (a good end)

Utilitarianism: act to bring the greatest amount of happiness to the greatest number

objections:
ci: Ask a psycho or otherwise bad-minded person, would you want others to act the way you do, and they would say yes. Also: doesn’t work when given two choices, both good, just one is better, like choosing which kid goes to college.

u: action movie scenario: you have to kill in order to save many people, but you can’t kill

Neither really follow the complexity of reality. They are just **models of morals**, as used in comic books, such as *Watchmen* and Batman.

**All are merely beourgiosie ideas: in that, the ruling class made all this shit up in order to try to rationalize decision-making. None of it really applies to real life, even just every-day simple decision-making.**

# 3
Mill - On Liberty

tried to answer: **when should the state ever interfere with society?**

harm principle: when one harms another, physically harms
social-harm [forgot the actual term] principle: when one indirectly harms another i.e. porn (assuming the making of it didn’t harm anyone, and, even then, having people pay people to have sex is not morally clear), evil media, flag-burning etc.

So, the harm principle is rather extreme, as it doesn’t take into account all of the structural violence, complex forces, media-social-life making. Yet, it wouldn’t be right (for the state) to (try to) control everything either (China), and, it’s not easy to choose. (Anyway, there is no way to control any of it any-more with current technologies. Life goes on, deal with the bad media.)

freedom principle: ? [dont remember], need (‘positive’) freedom in order to excercise liberty, cant do much with such liberties without any money, people need enabling factors: money, home, social equality, positive laws (Rosa Parks), etc.
autonomy principle: all morals come from within, it doesn’t count if some-one else such as an authority makes a decision for you, even God, you have to decide one everything

Hegel

**All of the previous junk is done by the beauorgoise, the ruling class of people at that moment of time.** Some of the principles and ideas used just as a way to aid talking, some-times even justify things in courts, such as the harm principle. But, one must remember, the courts favor the bankers, the state-workers, both of whom happen to be white male millionaires, which certainly is not coincidence. Similarly, utilitarianism is used by economists to favor the rulers.

Hegel looks at freedom as a historical process: history consists of a series of pivotal events (civil war, war, etc.), **the struggle at each historical moment (in time) is freedom.** So that we are progressing toward a more and more free society with each struggle, until there are no more struggles, which is the end (communism?).

But, he didn’t envision the 1984 or Blade Runner type of ends which better fit contemporary realities, where although there is no struggle, everyone is completely determined, unaware of the problems of society, not struggling or unable to struggle to change it.

And, unfortunately, more wars continue, although some-times labeled ‘for freedom’ for the opposite reason: for control (Gulf War, Iraq War, War on Drugs, etc.).

This, is very different from past ‘virtue ethics’ and the much later more Enlightenment-style rationalizations and calculations by Kant, Bentham, and Mill. This **uses history as it’s only source for moral-learning.** Not mere statements or ideals. Which is, much closer to contemporary reality than a bunch of white ruling males in offices of universities.

Marx

‘human requirements’: water, food, shelter

In Washington, D.C., right now, the homeless sleep under bridges, next to giant, lavish architectures of state buildings. **The inequality is clear. More-so, the stupid use of capital is clear.** **It is obvious that simply giving money to the poor is better than the rich to try to handle how the poor should use their money through endless bureaucracies, wasting money and time (time of poor people being disabled) in the process, despite all of the past lofty moral discussions by the rich.** **Contemporary civilization is retarded.**

[**The way to live: survive and help others (that want to) to survive. Have fun doing it.**]
