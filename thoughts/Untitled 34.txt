[the day after the boat bonfire]
Mmmm, summer tea during the summery weather.

Can’t wait to be free.

Can’t wait, to be free.

[sort of continued thought form yesterday]
In this world, how many areas, not just mere artists communities and communes, but areas—city neighborhoods, rural areas suburban areas, etc.—do the majority of people treat others equally?

None.

None that I’ve seen.

All is majority unequal treatment.

The golden rule is tarnished.

Did the nomadic bands have a higher ratio [of equal to unequal treatment]? Hmmm... Maybe some did!

If so, human have degressed (opposite of progress?).

Hmmm...

The children have the most equal ethics, at least among peers. They still treat adults as authority. Then...somehow it all gets lost?

Or...was it just me? Was I the only child that shared everything?

Perhaps...!

Whoa.

[Against the Hindsight Fallacy]
He mentions no one could have guessed [at the time] tiny radical factions would have taken over a country, citing Christianity of the Roman Empire and Bolsheviks of Russia. I feel that one could see it, if one has the slightest intuition of the people’s culture. It’s intuitive to understand if people would or would not be in solidarity with a “radical religion” (just some set of beliefs and norms). It’s possible to tell that people are dissatisfied with capitalism, inequality in capital, inequalities in general in America to the point of doing something like the Occupy movements (I was living in Brooklyn at the time). It’s probably possible for the Arab Spring too. It was surely possible for the ones in Hong Kong and Taiwan (I was living in Taipei at the moment). You have to be completely detached from human society not to fathom it.

So, to sum up, the feeling exist in the culture, it just takes a “radical” group to pronounce the feelings (propaganda or otherwise), creating a social movement.

The most recent “surprise” was Trump. And, it’s only surprising if you don’t know the people; If you haven’t seen the culture of all those white people in the mid-west, rural areas, suburban neighborhoods, rich neighborhoods in cities, and all those old people, probably of any color. Campaign propaganda. Television propaganda. It’s as radical as it gets. Exclusive behaviors erupt. History repeats. Surprise!

The Trump movement and the Occupy movements were obvious to see happening (during my time). You just had to know the cultures, particularly, the all those white people, and, New York. No hindsight fallacy there.

The culture as parasite idea is a neat way of thinking about it.

Much of life problems are institutional problems. Much of institional problems exist simply because the cultures, the viruses exist. It is in reality (culture), in media, in education, everywhere. [The idea of] Prisons are everywhere. Police are everywhere. Government is everywhere. Property is everywhere. How do we stop the virus [of bad cultures] is the real question.

To rid them in reality, from the minds of current peoples, from the media for future peoples? Well, it might be nice to look back at prisons like we do now at witch-burning. No need to rid of the bad history.

Stopping cultural ideas...well, that seems impossible. It’s more about just changing reality, forcing the shut-down of bad cultural ideas. Treat it like tumors and surgically cut it out from society. That is indeed best.

Now, to do that, one would have to convince the entire nation of a state that the idea is bad, and, that we have to get rid of it.

Now I feel like a “radical faction”! Yay.

To do that, say, for prisons, would be to spread media (propaganda) about the bad treatment and uselessness of prisons. Then, some sort of plan? Pretty hard when the state has the army... Law is on the prison’s side. Protest? Meh. Counter-force really all I can think of. Mass prison-breaks.

The same counter-force action plan could be applied to all of those other bad cultural ideas.

.

The Black American movement sure does feel like a positive propaganda, with a constant stream digital videos of wrong-doings by the state. It’s fantastic. I think this sort of movement must be re-created for all wrong-doings around the world. Wake people up. Get shit going. Antagonize. At least increase the chance of anti-state (or anti any bad cultural idea) actions.

Facebook. Twitter. It’s all great for positive propaganda. Create accounts. Post wrong-doings of bad cultural-ideas.

Sounds fun.

**Perhaps it’s just the organization of it all that is key:** The organization of accounts, posting, distributing, marketing, of video documentation of wrong-doings. Yeah, it really might be!

Again, technology is on our side, and, I am one of the best sorts of people to use it. These are things I can do on my own, quite well.

Heck, maybe the videos already exist on-line! I just have to check in other languages. For example, Indonesian language for migrant worker abuses. Then, post it in the Chinese and English languages. This is turning out to be a great tech project! [**todo: new tech  project!**]

I would, of course have to be careful...and think about it. The state has to be a rather friendly sort. One that would actually be on the migrant worker side (or whatever the bad cultural idea is). If not, the state will squash them and me!

.

I have no idea how Yuval is comparing Post-modernist thinking and conversation of “discourses” similar to mimetics (the virus idea). He keeps simplifying things, to the point the juicy content is gone. He’s basically stereotyping everything in order to write a brief history. So, for communism, he chooses Soviet Communism. Surely for many religions he committed much stereotyping violence. Here, again, for Post-modernist thinkers.

...

resources -> research -> power -> resources...

The states use resources, some for power, some for tech (r&d), which results in more resources...

Hmm... yeah. Yeah...

Can crowd-funding break this? Putting the money into at least some one that is not the state? Sure. I mean, corporations aren’t the state (though many may have strong bonds [with the state]).

**Can crowd-funding be used to put money back into the people on the streets? The only way for that to happen is to give it to true anarchists. That’s rare.** But that’s where I’m at.

**Tell any really experienced good willed person to use crowd-funding to help them to do more good.** They must use technology to their advantage. Exponentially increase their good wills. Feed and shelter more and more people. Take care of more and more people. Teach more and more people to share, cooperate, etc. ‘Tis the hippie way.

Any financial resources (money) comes from crowd-funding. Any material resources comes as gifts from crowds, and shared by egalitarians. Any human resources comes from those that are willing to volunteer for share causes. Though, I could use some money to pay fellow hippies, especially when their current works so bad. But, that would indeed go against the golden rule... Yeah, I would have to house them first, pay whatever debts they have, let them live in the community, doing whatever they want. That’s most ideal.

**We, the people, really do need to have mastered technology.**

**We, the people, really need to master force. Self-defense, whatever legal items: pepper spray, tazers, etc.**

> **The acquisition of new powers.** Modern science is not content with creating theories. It uses these theories in order to acquire new powers, and in particular to develop new technologies.
>...
>...it was repeatedly proven empirically.

My old pro-technology for good communities idea. Making tools for good communities...

...

The two paragraphs about ignorance: individual ignorance and collective ignorance is good insight into stupid people. The first: if a stupid person doesn’t know something, they ask someone else. The second: the whole tradition focuses on certain things and deeming them important; And everything else unimportant. This ostracizes all other knowledge, nearly requiring those against the majority or hegemony to create their own school of thought.

The first says that people are not empirical. Luckily, in America, science teaches otherwise, leading people to be quite empirical about humans too. The second says the main ideology selects what knowledge is important and which isn’t. Most people fall within the main ideology and just simply don’t reach out for anything beyond that. People aim for good grades during school, money after school, having a good family, and the process repeats. There isn’t much to life out-side of this.

[funding research]

[todo: now: Save files. 4. Voice Dream? 5. Finish KickStarter writing. Tomorrow: submit Kickstarter. Only eat at night? Nah. Just eat less rice during the day. Eat two servings of veggies, but the smallest amount of rice. No soup. Unless it’s delicious.]

[The Sugar Daddies of Science]
Science, as a giant system, needs a lot of money, but individuals doing research experiments that don’t require much money don’t. And, with a little DIY could accomplish a lot. All of that, self-funded, just as any other artist is, by doing whatever work for money.

Yeah, science groups, like the academy of sciences or whatever, are / were linked to politics, but surely a ton of independent thinkers existed. Science, to Yuval, is limited to the institutionalized-complex: academia, research centers, military research, etc. Or, during the time of the explorers, expeditions funded by European governments. The independent explorers are skipped over by historians, as are billions of artists.

**Now, with crowd-funding, does it matter so much? Crowd-funding shifts the financial aqueducts, from the old route of government to people, to the new route of people to people. Basically, crowds are the new financial foundation.** Furthermore, **crowds, unlike states, are way more likely to fund projects that have no political or economic value, such as, arts.**

His example of two scientists with cow-related projects is great. Quite a bit of time of my life was wasted because I simply thought there would be someone, whether a foundation created by a person that seemed sane, NGOs, and even at two points in my life, academia, that might be sane enough to fund my dreams. Most of that time was wasted. What I got out of it was the writings of my dreams, in a form guided by grant guidelines. The only one that agreed was one who just wanted more of my money!—the top art school. **There is no hope in any of those foundations. They are all ancient.** **All of the hope, I believe, relies on crowd-funded, friend-group-funded (which is precisely where crowd-funding get its initial kick of funding), and personally-funded endevours.** Most works are personally-funded.

The old foundations should rightfully die and make way for the far more accurate, quantifiable crowd-funding. The old foundation-grantee system was rather random: Rich people created a foundation. Someone in it somehow chooses the projects. That’s where the money goes. **It all depended on the ideology of the people who have a say in where the money goes.**

**Now, as long as there are people out there with similar values willing to donate money to a project, it’s possible the project will be funded.** **Which means, just about any sort of project has the possibly to get funded.**

This is the current digital foundation. Just as digital market-places disrupted traditional, physical markets, so too do digital foundations. Why check the physical markets when you can check the world on eBay, or the world-store on Amazon? Well, there are physical reasons, but, otherwise, just order online! Similarly, why check old foundations when you can try crowd-funding?

“Angel investing” in Silicon Valley was quite a disruption too, even before crowd-funding really took off. Here, a bunch of rich technocrats directly invested in more technology. And so the feedback loop becomes: invest in technology, get money, invest... Even more simple than the science loop! As long as it gets money, the investors are happy. **There are no morals in Silicon Valley.** Hence, dreadful “games”, dreadful apps, and other dreadful technologies, such as those of the most dreadful Elon Musk. **Moral-less people just chasing money, destroying nature, taking advantage of the frail human psyche in every way possible to get more money, quantifying everything evermore.**

At least with science there was a check. In addition to getting money (economy), it often had a political interest. Funding war machines, sure, but also the rest of government functions, including health and security. With direct investors, there’s no check. It doesn’t have to do anything, except, make money!

**Crowd-funding is almost the opposite of direct investment. The crowd doesn’t get anything in return (save "rewards"). It’s not a investment, as in a stake of the project. It’s just money flowing into whatever people value. And that’s beautiful! That’s the ideal! Put your money exactly into the projects that you value, *directly*!** It may be one of the best inventions ever!

Or worst. Like Silicon Valley, the values of the funders still suck. Silicon Valley investors value money. If they value anything else, it comes *after* money. **The crowd’s, that is, the public’s values, though much better, really depends on their interests [at that moment]. And their interests depends on their culture. And that culture is American culture [at that moment]**, since America has the most people and most money using crowd-funding.

American culture is simultaneously beautiful and scary. It could potentially fund and over-fund anything, but most of the time, it’s quite predictable. Things that Americans love, such as an entertainment media—an old favorite film, game, toy, sci-fi book, etc.—will ensure that the makers’ new project will be funded. So, one has to play the popular game. Fund a new Goonies movie? Or anything from Nickelodeon? Sure, a million [dollars]. Fund a fine artist or social theorist? Far less people, if any.

A lot of it has to do with what’s on the mind of Americans at the moment (celebrities, Black American movement...) and marketing tactics. Nostalgia is easy bait. 90s anything. Thats prime traditional media turned internet generation—the generation that likely most used crowd-funding. Otherwise, **it’s usually just sheer consumerism interests.**

Moral projects are quite rare and receive far less than entertainment projects. **Moral projects are also extremely unevenly distributed [(I mean, it has to be. Not everyone is making crowd-funding projects for every project that they do)].** So, is it really better than the old foundations?

Hmmmm. Now, I’m not so sure.

Foundations are just old-thinking, but at least there were some quality assurance, good intentions, and guidelines in mind for each foundation, at times making decent choices. Crowd-funding is pop-thinking, and the American crowd is much more consumerist than moralist. The result is probably wild, with both the good and the bad, no filter. **It’s capitalism, no filter.**

Hmm.

It really depends on Americans’ culture, education, and attention span. That’s so scary. **It seems Plato’s problem still exists here: there has never been a philosopher in control. In this case, of where the money goes.** **And so, we’ve gone through 2000 or so years just to reach the same societal problem: the idiots are in control of society.** Ugh.
