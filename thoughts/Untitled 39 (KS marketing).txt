# marketing thoughts
Do I really think this is possible? With just Twitter?

Spam everyone through Twitter?

artists
groups (organizations)
  - publishers
  - groups of artists?
celebrities? (pop social media)

Hmmm.... Maybe.

**With so many interests, why not? This is my most marketable project.** Other projects are more niche.

The Revolution of Everyday Life? Illich?

**Anyway, it’s quite a good way to connect to people, network, really begin a digital life...**

From there, I can build up digital projects, networks, etc. A name could be made of my digital *presence*: Ra the wolf. **Ra the willowolf**. RaTheWillowolf. Or RahilTheWolf. That shall be my anarchist name. The person that I used to be. The one that built projects, was self-sufficient, had incredible work ethics... But lived digitally?

I shouldn’t be so digital-dependent...

I need to get back into the lands of Taiwan, and, the rest of this earth.

The whole thing disconnects me from locality...

Not being part of the local market means I’m not part of the local area, because I’m using so much time away from both.

But that’s not necessary. I think it’s just poverty that’s really disabling me. If I had money, I’d be all around Taiwan, motorcycling about, freely, happily. I’d be documenting DIY-filled homes, natural ethics, searching for viable places to begin utopian places...

**It should be possible to do both: express myself digitally (getting money through the digital markets via KickStarter) and stay in tune with the local areas. Every digital expression should use locality as its source.**
