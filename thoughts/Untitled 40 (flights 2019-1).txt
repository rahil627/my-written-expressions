TigerAir - 2020 (1300 + 500 ootw fee + 220 booking fee)
  - able to use web check-in?
    - [todo] can e-mail about it
  - their counters always ask for onward flight
Peach - 2180+ (1680 + 500 ootw fee)
  - [todo] should try to check full price, maybe worth the the kiosk to avoid systematic behavior people
  -   - should still try to avoid giving Japan money though
  - “All passengers departing from Japan (except Haneda and Shin-Chitose airport for international flights) are required to complete check-in at the Peach Kiosks.
    No gate check-in or transit desk check-in is possible for Peach customers. All customers must finish check-in at the check-in counters or kiosks.”

HK Express - 1178 (438 + 500twsc + 240)
  - no more Hualien flights :(
    - still the best airport though
    - hitching to/from Taizhong can suck.

**Hong Kong $75** (from Taizhong)
  - 300ntd train or bus, then transfer to another bus that goes to the airport, 4+ hours by either train, 3+ by bus! So, would have to hitch-hike the day before, or morning of a night flight. Too far by motorcycle. Still cheaper than the other options, with the best airport (lounge area and immigration). Able to get a short stay (3-6 hours) between flights. Quite good! Just have to play with fares and schedules a bit... but it might be $100, not $75, in which case, Tiger/Peach same day would be better
  - likely have to book early to get the best fares Buses are better than trains too, being warmer.
  - in conclusion: good for any schedule, and works well for night-owls. Also saves stamp space!! But have to plan ahead, a month or two ahead to get the best fares.
Vietnam $124
  - need to book pseudo-visa thingy first
**Japan $126**
  - have to use TigerAir and Peach combo to get same day return, as the Peach departure and arrival flights are around the same time (~11am and ~1pm). Otherwise, sleeping out-side can be cold or rainy!
  - Japanese people are the worst. Robots. All of them. Good airport size and lay-out though.
  - can book up to the last day without fare difference with both TigerAir and Peach. So, incredible emergency flexibility.
  - in conclusion: good for warm times and emergencies. Perfect if you get the same day flights with Tiger.
Macau $133
  - 24-hour airport, but terrible people and place (a fucking casino area!)
Philippines $134
  - **worth buying spices from**, and getting some snacks!

Tainan airport has a China Airlines flight to Hong Kong, but its expensive: $230
TNN to vietnam $137, with a 24 hour airport!
  - **worth trying.** Might be warm. Might can go out and get delicious food!

Thailand from RMQ
  - also **worth it for the spices** and food and travels! Would be nice to have a motorcycle in one of these other SE Asian countries... Then, could just travel and tent

Peach - 1680 (5000jpy + 1000 “international tourist tax” + 540 “payment fee”)
  - kiosk-only check-in
  - can avoid payment fee by purchasing ticket at the counter, but, not sure if you can reserve it...
  - sucks really badly to sleep in the cold, so, only do this combo if it can be done on the same day
TigerAir - 1800 (likely +220 booking fee?)
HK Express - 1748 (438 + 360 + 500 hkdt + 210 hkgs + 240)
