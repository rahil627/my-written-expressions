Sunday, sun-day, sun-ny day is the day we live. Wake up naturally, to the sun; late, warm. Perhaps there’s still a giant to-do list on one’s mind; The sun slowly beats it out of you.

Don’t fight it. Don’t take caffeine. Don’t take a shower. Bath in the sun.

The world comes into view; The bees n’ butterflies. The weeds ‘n trees. The yards ‘n parks. Those past things to-do seem silly now. Now one just desires to take care of one’s abode: wash clothes, repair belongings, eat left-overs, wash one’s body (thoroughly!).

If sun-day lasted any longer, one would begin to walk around one’s home, see the people and natural areas nearby, [naturally] creating new local projects.

If it lasted even longer, those local projects would lead into more local interactions.

And if it lasted long enough, those natural, frequent local interactions would develop into *local care*.

Too bad everything currently goes against that [idea]: the system, traditions, education, artificial environments: the culture derived [from all of them].
