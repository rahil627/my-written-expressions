a little chilly tonight.

So cold that I don’t even feel groping!

Now what...? Freedom. Best walk on the beach ever. Can actually walk without feeling exhausted by heat and humidity.

-1. charge iPad now, in case of rain
0. Have to ask ALiang or XiaoMiMi for 500NT. Then, pay auntie 50, oil 200-300, and keep the rest for gas and food on Sundays. Can try chain-calling with 5NT at a time, or, ask to use someone’s phone with my sim card.
0. Give 50NT to auntie, tell no work
c/1. try selling keyboard (week-days: thurs, fri)
1. contact construction guy via messenger (at family mart during the night, or, at the log during the day)
  - need to check if I have his name...
    - remembered!: it’s on the clip-board!
2. Contact that one dude via 7-11 phone for help. (near bhuddist restaurant, or find one nearby)
  - work, day-pack, inform no phone, but live behind the fishing shop.
  - can ask for some money to buy one month internet service, and...250NT gas
  - can also ask to use his RvTian account
  - need to find his number...
    - remembered!: i still have his business card in my day-pack’s pouch!
  - can even do this now, as i fetch water...
    - check convenient stores on the way
      - need to break 100NT down to 50, 4 10s, and 2 5s
      - 7-11 has one!
        - ugh, fucked up—wasted 5NT on one voice-mail. Need to press “next call” next time... can try calling from the church, but feel like I should be low-key about it...
   - can also even e-mail him, to his work e-mail (at family mart or log)
4. Can create signs at the beach...”looking for work, inform the fishing shop”
  - make it during the day.
  - island people looking for work, just tell the fishing shop
  - put it on the tourist walk-ways
  - put it in a less rainy location, beneath a bench? not sure...
  - try to do this before the weekend
6. Try using wifi in front of the house (or at the mart at night) to find nearby work? List numbers to call. Facebook message people all day. Apply to schools in Taidong area? Check for any work in that area! Yay. Here we go! Listen to 8tracks too! Woo!
7. Work, date / sex, alcohol or dance music to just do the stupid work.

Inform church girl that I still don’t have the money. (can message through Facebook: successful visa trip but still no work).

d. eat at bhuddist restaurant. Drink hot black tea and cool oolong tea.
d. clean up common room (table), laundry work clothes really really well, laundry other clothes, clean up my own room (table) and pack.
w. eat oatmeal and coffee on the weekends and bhuddist holidays

Just need one fucking gig. Or, selling of the keyboard.
  - then can fetch camera gear and try to sell that!
  - sell on eBay vs RvTian? eBay would be kinda useless...except for plane tickets.

Take hot black tea and use internet at the log.

**Trust the market, not the people. People are irrational. The market shows people’s true intentions,** ‘putting money where the mouth is’ / ‘money talks’.

Really need a craigslist like system for Taiwan to short period work.

Really need to begin my own business asap: busking and selling tea, then, chai, then, making and selling alcohol. Otherwise, it’s all Kickstarter for art, anarchy, local community / environment projects.
  - but is it worth it? The lonely organizational work of making and selling drinks? Isn’t simply delivery better? But...it’s so difficult to score the job... Well, we’ll see. Just need to try a few different companies is all... Once I get a hang of finding a few good jobs, then, it’s all good. Back to organizing art and anarchy.

I need to get in a social mood again, being in a social atmosphere, to be social enough to even look for work—calling people up, following-through, staying in tune with communication, etc. Hopefully, music is enough to make me social enough. Play some tunes, be happy, message and call.

I really hope that doing some sort of delivery work will keep me in tune with society, especially on the east side. Otherwise, I’m not sure how I’d get close to them (the people there). Everyone is in their own world, their own tribe, their own house. It’s so isolating. Are there even any events? Any interesting people? I’m really not sure. Perhaps, I really have to rely on the internet... Everything there appears to be rural businesses held by closed-off families. Ugh.

There are day and night markets. So, that’s not bad. Otherwise...it seems pretty difficult to do anything together...

Perhaps it’s just a matter of organizing, open-mics, showing intentions, show-and-tell, understanding the people around. At least the hippies, and hopefully the aboriginals too. Surely there can be some work to be done together... If not, go to other places to work together for a short period of time, then, come back.

Perhaps there needs to be a local social platform tool. A social platform that prioritizes things that are happening closes to you. For example, if a nearby friend is leaving the area to go work. Or, if there’s an event nearby. So, one can stay in tune with the area, digitally.
