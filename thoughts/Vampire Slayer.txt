Normally I instictively detract from mentioning that there were some lonely periods in my life when the kids on my street didn’t come out to play, and I turned to games, and, the type of game I feel ashamed about are FPSs.

I was a PC person. I had Half-Life and played mods from modded.com. I’d usually wander and try servers that played custom maps, sometimes even those party servers will all sorts of sounds you had to download.

The game I’m having a memory of at the moment is Vampire Slayer...At least, I think that was the name.

It was fighitng, in FPS form. Straight brawls. Shimmies. Scenarios with 1v1s, 1v3s, 4v4s, everything.

It was simple. A Half-Life 1 engine mod. Vampires vs humans. One with super bunny hopping abilities and [naer?] one hit melee kill, and, the other with various weapons and a stake and cross. To kill a vampire, you had to beat them down, then, when they’re knocked down, stab their heart with a stake. To kill a human, you had to touch them, with your claws. [Maybe it was more than one hit...?]

Yet, that was the simple game that created more fun moments than all of the other mods that I played at that time: Firearms, Day of Defeat, Team Fortress Classic, and a sweet ass cyberspace themed one.

And, I think that’s worth investigating. What made Vampire Slayer so great, and all of the other FPSs seem like a bunch of spam and awp.

Man, where to begin?

I mean just the shimmy was great. 

The vampire had ridiculous movement, could jump down from buildings, out of dark areas, see in the dark...It was constant paranoia to be a human in that game...until you built a new set of nerves.

But in **the shimmy**, it wasn’t too much. Left, right, left, left, right, giant bunny hops that you could curve like a curve-ball that left heads rolling. That was the fight in the open. Closed spaces became different, leading to the funniest janky zombie-barricade situations, but, at it’s core, that was it.

And, that’s what fighting FPSs boil down to. Maybe some map, or weapon, or team strategy...but 1v1, the game is somewhere in there. When you’re the last one on your team, and the rest of them watching you, you were putting on a show. 1 human vs 3 vampires: use the standard snotty for stray hits, double barrel when the get close, take chances trying to stake a downed vampire without getting jumped by the other vampires. Freeze Tag scenarios everywhere. Do you really think you can tag that frozen vampire without getting tagged yourself? For the vampires, should you stick close to your friends who can save you, or should you take a chance and glory and go alone to get that last kill? Stay in the light and everyone will see you. Stay in the dark and you’ll start hitting Dark Tag scenarios.

Play-ground simplicity. Fun. Competitive. Fighting.

All of those other FPSs? Hard-core hand-eye coordination rewarded in CS. Spam in TFC because you weren’t **punished for dying**—you could re-spawn; There’s no competition when you have infinite lives. The game had objectives that were annoying, so it just made sense to play the game of getting the most kills on the server. The team doesn’t matter.

FireArms, was the standard FPS I played the most, combining elements of TFC classes and custom classes[!!], CS real-ness , n’ all. Shimmies were good, but not Vampire Slayer intense or suspense. Still great though, quick. Clips emptied quick [for some guns], and reloading meant doom. Clan / tournament matches worked surprisingly well. Still a lot of spam at environmental bottle-necks.

Day of Defeat was the standard FPS two of my friends were more into, very similar to FireArms, just less play-styles imo. For some reason that surely can be deducted[?...], I was more into FA, and two friends the this. FA played more like TF, in that the teams were clearly pushing or pulling... I just don’t remember DoD much.

That cyber-space game was also great, like TF2 or whatever that newer TF-like game is. I preferred it over TF2. Excellent team fighting scenarios of various classes doing their things. Excellent 5v5 battles going on all of the time. But, still, never reaching the great heights of the moments of either Vampire Slayer or GoldenEye.

And, it’s worth figuring out why, because that’s what makes fighting games so great.
