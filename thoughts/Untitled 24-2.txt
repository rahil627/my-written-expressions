The Notebook Transcriptions of an Utopian Wanderer turned Vagabond

# sub-title
The search, transcription, and organization of up to 8 years of physical writings, tailored for the internet, along with the re-organization of the previously transcribed writings.

# the project
I’m a life-long philosopher / social theorist / conceptual thinker / essayist / concept-and-idea-machine. Yep, *that* person. Life’s circumstances has now brought me to a point where I’ve decided to exchange my mind for money. :(
This project is to fund me to transcribe my physical writings. First, the ones that I currently have with me, then, any that I’m able to retrieve. I’m partial to those written during the past few years, but the writings date back to when I first left my home-town in 2011. In the process of doing so, I hope to use the money to climb out of poverty and put me in a good state of organization again: basically, get my shit together.
At the moment I have: two of my main note-books, three note-pads, an old travel-size note-book (a gift from my sister for my first trip), and a mess of items I’ve written on [picture at end]. They mostly contain simple thoughts about humans—real, personal, original social theories, discourses, essays—, but also just simple thoughts, observations, concepts, ideas, and dreams. I have a lot more writings, but retrieving them will require impossible amounts of luck (more on this later).
I will transcribe them first by photo; Second, by typing, re-wording and re-expressing in the process; Third, by organizing into a web-site, adding categorization info (title, keywords [tags], links, etc.).
There was only one period in my past that I actually tried to transcribe my writings: it was during another period of isolation and poverty in 2014. It resulted in a sort of child-like philosophy foundation (in the good sense!), creating my own set of concepts / words. The relic of my past mind still exists at rahilpatel.com. (Visiting the site is clearly the best way to see what sort of monster this project is and my mind can be.)
Unfortunately, that period was somewhat derailed by academic bullshit because I was using academic philosophy books as an aid to try to find ways to express my then wild mind into writing. Don’t worry, mistake learned. I’m on my Black America real shit again, as I was when I was grew up.
In the end, I hope to have organized my writings into text files, which can then be auto-generated into public web-pages (like blog posts), using simple contemporary software.
My passions and creativity are currently at a life-time low, so, perhaps this is a good time for mere organizing information?... Anyway, the money will enable me to live better days and go back to doing some *real* organizing: commune-making, starting by transforming my current home into a communal space, then creating more. :)
*...Can a purely public crowd really fund purely passionate people, such as philosophers?*

# bio and mind during the writings
I believe the last two notebooks (#3-pink and #4-tan) mostly cover a period of isolation and poverty (mostly losing hope against conservative minds), with the exceptions of one hitch-hiking trip in Japan, and two communal stays in Hong Kong and Taiwan. I believe between notebooks #2 and #3 I mostly wrote digitally, covering a long period at a commune (mostly utopian thoughts :) :) ). My second main notebook, which is most likely lost forever, physically and digitally, I believe, covers my deepest philosophy period (human treatises). Those three were mostly written in Taiwan. My first main notebook, I believe, covers my travel observations in various areas of Asia (“human geography”, development / technology / mediums and culture, etc.), when I had money to travel with relative ease. I believe my writings before that, in American cities, were mostly written digitally via smart-phone. *Praise the Dropbox gods!*

# content of the writings
Hopefully the content is probably what the backers care about, that or good will, which is where my wandering personality may be at detriment, as the content wanders with me.
The content of just the last notebook, off-the-top [of my head], includes: the poverty trap, what is tradition?, what is a conservative mind?, and then the normal: reflections on my past and my personality, development / environmental state of mind, lots of utopian thoughts (practical and theory), anarchy, community, commune-making, place-making, capitalism, human values (and intentions), institutionalized cultures (White, Chinese Taiwanese, Korean, Japanese) vs real cultures (Black American, Native Taiwanese), American media culture, political correctness in cultures (west coast vs east coast), competitive game culture, community and personality theory, community and cultural theory, what is natural life?, comparison of behaviors and ethics, etc. etc.:**basically, what you would expect from a childish idealist encountering various contemporary cultures of human life.**
Though the topics seem dense, the writings are short, straight-forward concept-oriented thoughts and observations; They are not fully-developed ideas or essays, though, later entries may be lengthy. There is no “research” in the academic sense. **There is only me thinking of my own past personal experiences, and, me dreaming.** The best I can hope is that my writings have the plain layman style of writers like David Graeber and Yuval Harrari but with the unwieldy intuitive utopian important content of the Situationists, yet, without any of their historical research or even any history at all; So not *Debt* nor *Sapiens*, but more about me just trying to live naturally, constantly clashing with non-cooperative, non-altruistic human (android) cultures. I substitute academic-ness for sheer direct personal expressions: observations and experiences, feelings, wanderings, and imagination.

# recovering lost writings
If I get a laptop, I can try to repair my external hard-drive, which might have a photo-copy of a notebook #1 and maybe even some of #2 (along with lots of valueable photos and other files :( :( ).
If it’s possible to fix my e-book reading app installation, I might be able to fetch additional thoughts / writings that I wrote directly into the app as annotations. My e-book library *was* my main library, containing highlights and annotations of 100+ books [picture at end].
The last bit of writings are at home, safe, in America: notebook #1 (*I think...I hope...*) and a bunch of scribblings on the margins of books of my physical library.
I believe I lost my best notebook at an airport, the phone with the photo-copy of it at a library parking lot a period of time before that, and the laptop with everything at a city a period of time after that.

# where the money goes
80-97% ~3 month’s labor and gear
3-5% KS fees
0-15% taxes? (the theory is that as long it counts as labor or gear, I’m good?)
 
where the money really goes:
$90 mobile internet for 3 months
$70 1 year renewal web-hosting and domain, plus a second domain
$20 CMS software license
$30 a good usb battery
$200(-700) two old iPhones (4/5) + old laptop with a good battery (depends on KS amount and material contributions)
($60) portable solar charger (optional)
$0 travel fees to search for a lost notebook (can hitch-hike this...)
$0 travel fees to fetch scattered belongings (short motorcycle trips)
$100 survival todos: motorcycle repair, tent repair, shack repair
$300 hippie business startups: a good travel stove and gas tank, midi busking equipment
$300 living well for 3 months
$? returning gifts to the people that helped along the way
$x% fees and taxes
chai and buttered toast, mmm... (will accept chai leaves and masalas as contribution)

The KickStarter amount doesn’t exactly reflect a calculated itemized cost total ($1000); Instead, the amount really is just a number I made up to make me feel safe enough to bounce back and be able to do the transcriptions peacefully. Y’all know KS amounts don’t make sense anyway as the labor wages and living costs depends on each individual!... I decided to triple it, setting it to about 3 months *minimum* wage ($3000 + $300 max KS fees + $0 min taxes). ~3 months of lower quartile to median wage is my ideal goal ($6k to 9k), and I’d be riiiiich biiiiich! Anything beyond that goes to the commune stash: maintaining a communal space, and, in turn, nurturing and providing for outcasts, artists, and other pure-hearted-lifestyle peoples.
Honestly, this is just a way I thought of to get out of poverty while still doing “work”. By funding this project, I’ll be able to get the gear not only to do this project, but also *enable* me to do more digital projects, giving me access to the digital market.
If I get enough money for an old laptop (RIP beloved late 2013 MacBook Pro 13”), or gifted one by a contributor, I will be able to take more time to create a better digital writing workflow (technically: migrate to a statically generated web-site. RIP Wordpress.) At the moment, all I have left is an iPad Mini 2 and a bluetooth keyboard, which, as this proposal proves, is surprisingly good enough to begin!
After the winter season, I’ll gladly go back to the art-life of balancing hippie market labors and labors of love—but first, I just need to fly out of the trap and re-create a communal hang-out home.
Just to be clear, this project will be self-“published”, publicly available digitally [on the internet], free. There are no intentional profits beyond the amount KickStarted. There are no intentions to publish (with a publisher), neither paper or digitally, not even to “anarchist publishers”. What’s a publisher anyway? {*begin GZA track*} *A penguin with random teks cashin’ in on random texts, uni-checks, OR hex? Real birds jinx(ed): This is only built 4 computer links!* :P

# beyond the KickStarter amount
I just want to emphasize that *this project’s main scope merely covers a transcription of my physical writings.* It’s that simple. Actually figuring out what I meant [at that moment], drawing out long essays, philosophizing are all not part of the scope. Though, at times, it will surely naturally happen during the process. Knowing myself, especially at this age, I probably won’t get too entangled in it this time. How deep I get into the work, only time will tell.
Having said that, I feel the more money this project would get, the better I would be able to at least re-express myself (re-word), organize everything (by entries [thought / idea / concept / essay], fitting multiple entries together by topic), and get closer to more accurately capturing and expressing my past thoughts and mind states. (Again, wander my web-site to get the gist of what I mean and how I did that the first time [todo: link web-site, link a specific post or anchor to a list of posts].)
An enormous amount of writings were written digitally, simultaneously with the physical notebooks: I wrote anywhere convenient. Though larger in quantity, I feel at times it’s lesser in quality of content than my physical writings. Any more money could lead to the wild project of the organization of everything I’ve written. That was possible 6 years ago, when I wrote very little. Now, I’m not so sure.
Although 3 winter months of labor is the ideal project cycle duration for me, this is likely a life-long project (Which is good, because for tax purposes, I think I’m supposed to try to spend it all on the project.). The hope is that after piecing together a good set of tools and doing this much needed bit of organization, I’m set for life, able to write and publish without technical disturbances.

# the start of the future
This project also serves as the beginning point to all other KickStartable projects, as the writings also contain most of my project ideas. Having a laptop and a good home really is all I need to begin a ton of tiny digital projects: pro-DIY-ethics tools, essay films, and even essay games.
This project alone might naturally lead to a creation of a few tools along the way!: my own writing syntax (like Markdown), my own editing syntax and grammar symbols, CMS tools to ideally generate all content from Dropbox, fetch and list text that have been marked (highlighted, annotated, rated) on iOS...Urgh! Maybe not...
*Can’t we all just go back doing what we feel is natural and right? Living, together?*

# a disclaimer about the rewards
Beyond the first enforced reward, there really aren’t any rewards; I care about nature, material workers, and postal workers. I doubt shallow rewards could satisfy a contributor of mine. :)
By contributing though, you can join the dialogues and dialectics of the practicality of utopias / anarchies, and I’ll take the time to listen, think, imagine, and share with you. I’ll take in whatever advice or info you’ve got, whatever desires you have into consideration, with a wayward fight. Everyone will be able to contact me (e-mail, maybe can try a Slack sort of medium?). If there’s anything else, I’m sure we can figure it out.
The contributor community has only now come to my attention. Just having a community of utopian contributors come together and hang-out digitally is an awesome idea in itself. Even better than this entire project!... Hrmmm... I’m sure more opportunities for more natural gifts will come up...
Oh!: One side reward that comes from the project will be my digital workflow. I’m quite notorious [todo: link to old one] about choosing minimalist tools to express my mind as quick as possible, no matter the medium. I plan to use both Kirby [CMS] and maybe try Hugo [SGS CMS]. So, for those that express themselves through digital content, I could serve as a friendly digi-artist spirit. Maybe there’s an e-zine movement?
If you fund me and have no intentions of communicating, then, all I really got is love for ya:
**<3**

# past works
My old media projects (“artist portfolio”) can still be found at rahilpatel.com/... [todo: get link]. I haven’t expressed myself through other forms of media for quite a few years. For now, just consider voluntary communal work as my recent "art works". Besides, for most of my life, my work is done communally, just helping the people nearby me, so, like most real work, mostly done by females, it’s not really given attention: real actions, and, the thoughts in these writings.

# pictures

My writings that I currently have on me, including notebooks #3 and #4.

My broken e-book application.

My current home: A steel shack rented by a surfer.

My beloved motorcycle: A Honda Cub clone.

My oh my. My oh, me. [todo: edge-up beard]

# risks and challenges
Poverty! Haha. I now have the essential human needs, but no electricity. I charge at a nearby out-door socket. Hence, the solar panel idea. If necessary, there’s a pleasant library and a less pleasant convenience store nearby. The library even has computers for public use. Hence, the old iPhones being way way more valuable than a laptop. Otherwise, I’m just bundling up for some wintry writing, and hopefully make a comfy space for anyone to join. :)
Money transfer and ordering electronics. It might take a bit of time initially...but, there are many other options to try: Paypal transfer, digital currency transfer...I’ll see if KickStarter can directly send to my foreign debit cards, if not, I think I’ll have the replacement card shipped in time anyway (my US banks are really really good). Even without the transfer, I can at least begin ordering some electronics. [I’ll try to remove this bit once I solve it.]
Normally I’m wayyy too active and passionate to do this sort of non-social, non-creative, chore-like work, but, luckily for this project, I now live alone and winter just arrived. *Praise the weather gods too!*

# cut
environmental design [natural vs institutional]

Notably essays—written essays, film essays, game essays—, but also many small pro-DIY-community digital projects. But first, *the ideas must be saved!*

[cut form money: used first and last sentences]
Honestly, this is just a way I thought of to get out of poverty while still doing “work”. I usually live abroad. Luckily, I have a good home in nature with food, but unfortunately, it’s in a bad place with a nearby market and culture that are terribly conservative—traditional Asia terrible. I really feel the only way to get out of this trap is to try do some digital work (remote computer programming)—trust me on this, I’ve tried *a lot* to get out of this trap! So, by funding this project, I’ll be able to get the gear not only to do this project, but also *enable* me to find other digital ways and physical ways (vending, busking) to make money after this project.
