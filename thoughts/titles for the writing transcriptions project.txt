  - I really dig this, whether it’s a word or not
The Anarchist’s Notebooks
  - the truest title, but I’m purposely avoiding the word
The Sorcerer’s Stone
The Goblet of Fire
The Prisoner of Azkaban

The Utopianist’s Notebooks
  - I’m liking this one more and more over time
**The Nomadic Utopianist’s Notebooks**
  - this says a bit more

The Nomadic Utopianist’s Notebooks
The Nomadic Utopianist’s Writings
  - writings seems less adventurous than notebooks (or diary)

The Nomadic Utopianist’s Notebooks
  - sounds better, but sounds like a title of a fictional book
A Nomadic Utopianist’s Notebooks
  - sounds worse, but more real, and, more humble
A Real Nomad’s Notebooks
A Real Utopianist’s Notebooks
A Real Nomadic Utopianist’s Notebooks
  - too much wording
The Notebooks of a Nomadic Utopianist
The Notebooks of a Real Nomadic Utopianist

*The Utopian Notebooks*
*An Utopianist’s Notebooks*
*An Utopianist’s Notebooks*
*A Nomadic Utopianist’s Notebooks*
The Notebooks of a Real Nomadic Utopianist
  - sounds exotic, like BigFoot
*The Notebooks of a Real Utopianist*

The Nomadic Idealist’s Notebooks
  - ideal doesn’t have the meaning of society in it
— [the above was ported from Voice Dream Writer]

*The Utopian Notebooks*
*An Utopianist’s Notebooks*
*The Notebooks of a Utopianist*
  - maybe the best
*A Nomadic Utopianist’s Notebooks*
*The Notebooks of a Nomadic Utopianist*
  - even better?
  - The Notebooks of a x sounds better than x’s Notebooks. For example, The Sorcerer’s Stone vs The Stone of a Sorcerer.

*Markings of a Wolf*
*Marks ist Wolf* [todo: check ist meaning in German]
*Wolf Marks*
  - meh, too plain, like a bland pop fiction book
*Wolf Markings*
  - meh, too plain
*Wolf Marx: Notebooks of a Utopianist under Capitalism*

*Marks of a Wolf: The Notebooks of a Nomadic Utopianist 2011-2018*
  - I don’t like it without the ‘the’. It’s corny, like Blades of Steel.
*The Marks of a Wolf: Notebooks of a Nomadic Utopianist 2011-2018*
**The Marks of a Wolf: The Notebooks of a Nomadic Utopianist ~2011-2018**
  - can try ‘writings’ to better match marks

- triple-meaning: marks as in writings, as in scars, and as in Marx
Marks
Marks of the Past
Spectral Marks

marks.waywardwolf.com
  - wayward could mean head-strong or toward a way.
  - WWW is a good abbreviation.
marks.wolfoftheway.com
  - ‘the way’ is kinda ambiguous
  - ‘the way’ also seems as if there is only one way: *the way*, when, there are many, as the way comes from within, or, from nature
marks.wolfofnaturesway.com
  - seems repetitive, as a wolf is already part of nature...but not bad!
makes.wolfofthenaturalway.com
  - 'nature' is more powerful than 'natural'

marksofthe.waywardwolf.com
  - nope
soulof.waywardwolf.com
  - nope
soul.waywardwolf.com
  - yes

indian.waywardwolf.com
mountain.waywardwolf.com
  - doesn’t work as well as having wolf in he front

**marks.willowolf.com**
  - cute, but again, doesn’t work with sub-domain adjectives...wait a sec...it does! It does because it sounds like one kind of wolf already, like a pokémon. Awesome!
  - marks can be used for more complete writings?
 mountain.willowolf.com
   - perfect! Cool for project names, as it’s already cute and meaningful.
   - crafty.willowolf, hungry.willowolf, scavenging.willowolf, polar.willowolf, desert.willowolf
     - environments is a really good idea: river, sea, beach, city, farm, house, etc. Real wolf names suck because they are based on country names (African, Indian, etc.).
**mind.willowolf.com**
   - full SGS CMS
   - body, soul, heart, eyes, etc. for other personal (to me) sub-domains

Marks: The Notebooks of a Wolf 2011-2018
The Marks of a Wolf: The Notebooks of a Nomadic Utopianist ~2011-2018
**The Mind of a Wolf: The Notebooks of a Nomadic Utopianist ~2011-2018**
  - more accurate than marks. It’s not just writings, it’s my mind. Similar to ‘Mind on Fire’ for the bio of some romantic.
**The Mind of Will o’ Wolf: The Notebooks of a Nomadic Utopianist ~2011-2018**
  - will of wolf, will o the wolf, wispy wolf, wolf wisp
  - will o’ wolf, will-o’-the-wolf
  -

Will of the Wolf: The Notebooks of a Nomadic Utopianist ~2011-2018
Will-o’-the-Wolf: The Notebooks of a Nomadic Utopianist ~2011-2018
  - meh, too much hyphens

Will vs Mind
Will: the capability of a conscious choice and decision and intention
Mind: the faculty responsible for thoughts, feelings, conscious brain functions

**I feel like the project is more of my mind: thoughts, feelings.** Yet, **I feel that the big web-site idea is my will**; a bunch of wills. I will help the homeless. I will do this or that. It’s a way to satisfy my wills

So, willowolf.com still works. RatheWolf.com is also great. MindoftheWolf.com as re-direct?

**rathewolf.com - main personal domain**, to replace rahilpatel.com
  - doesn’t work well with sub-domains
  - really just limited to personal stuff: writings, and other arts: mind [writings], marks [notes], will [to willowolf.com], eyes [film essays], ears or tracks[music, sound recordings], memory-part-of-brain [photos], scent, fangs, tail, etc. body theme
mind.rathewolf.com - static generated writings site
will.rathewolf.com - willed tools
**willowolf.com secondary domain, impersonal domain**
  - works well with sub-domains (mountain willowolf, beach willowolf, forest willowolf, plains willowolf, American willowolf, Tibetan willowolf, Amazonian willowolf, etc. habitat theme)

**Will o’ Wolf: The Notebooks of a Nomadic Utopianist ~2011-2018**
  - Will of the Wolf, like Mind of the Wolf. Cool!

  - utopian [hopes, dreams],  nomadic / wanderer [temperament, habits, insticts!]
The Mind of Ra the Wolf: The Nomadic Utopianist (2011-18)
  - that describes Ra the Wolf, not the mind. So, it would be a biography.

The Mind of Ra the Wolf: Years of Wandering 2011-2018
The Mind of Ra the Wolf: The Romantic Years 2011-2018
  - but it wasn’t always romantic
The Mind of Ra the Wolf: Wandering and Rebelling in 2011-2018
  - the mind wanders and rebels. I like this better than facts and intentions: those more writing-themed words.
- it also conveys anarchy through rebel, nomadism through wander, and just straight-wandering through wander.

  - -‘ing’ with ‘in’ works well
  - just missing cooperating

The Mind of Ra the Wolf: A Rebellious Mind
The Mind of Ra the Wolf: The Wandering Rebellious Years

  - this covers it all: wandering: consuming everything, travel, rebel: always fighting against normative constraints, utopia: building a better world
The Mind of Ra the Wolf: Wander, Anarchy, Utopia 2011-2018
  - missing nature
The Mind of Ra the Wolf: Natural Anarchism 2011-2018

The Mind of Ra the Wolf: Constructing Natural Ethics 2011-2018
The Mind of Ra the Wolf: Dilineating Natural Ethics 2011-2018
  - defining, tracing, outlining

  - lol, this is really good
**The Mind of Ra the Wolf: Facts!... and Keeping it Real between 2011-2018**
  - this is really really good. Shows both, perceptions and natural ethics using layman language.
**The Mind of Ra the Wolf: Adventures of Keepin’ it Real 2011-2018**
  - any adventure to ‘keep it real’
  - real is a good philosophy word
  - mixes playfulness and black culture: adventure time and keeping it real
**The Mind of Ra the Wolf: Facts!... and Keeping it Real between 2011-2018**
The Mind of Ra the Wolf: The Ethics of Keeping it Real 2011-2018
  - **keeping it real = natural ethics!**
The Mind of Ra the Wolf: Seeking Nature’s Ethics 2011-2018
  - ethics, plural. This is more innate, as in, what a pure personality naturally does.

**The Mind of Ra the Wolf: Facts & Utopian Tracks 2011-2018**
**The Mind of Ra the Wolf: Facts!...and Utopian Tracks 2011-2018**
  - I still keep thinking foot-prints as opposed to paths.
  - the ...! Is a lot more playful.
**The Mind of Ra the Wolf: Facts!...and Utopian Tracts 2011-2018**
  - Tracts has a triple meaning: 1. a system of body parts that together serve some purpose. 2. a treatise on a particular subject, usually in the form of a booklet (a small book). 3. A bundle of nerve fibers following a path through the brain.
  - also just two letters from facts
**The Mind of Ra the Wolf: Facts! & Utopian Intentions 2011-2018**
  - this is still truest to the content: very much real, like real cultures; also, intentions is perfect. It’s not hopes.
