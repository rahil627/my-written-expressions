Dreaming of living on the east coast: taking a trip to buy bulk goods from a Western wholeseller, such as dry cereals for the morning. A large Wolf Children inspired fridge filled up with fresh soy-milk and un-sellable vegetables from nearby farms, and vegetables that I harvested from the wild -- water spinach and other cut-and-grow veggies. A clean fridge, despite being in an old shack.

Physically-needed part-time jobs nearby. Slow motorcycle rides through villages and farms to get anywhere; Remote work on my laptop; Nature always in view.

The desire is there, now. Slowly built up [over 3 months], from nothing -- No! From the opposite way of thinking.

Before, I thought of world progress. Social progress [throughout entirety of time and space]. Huge ideas. I lived off of the healthy, cheap, delicious foods that Asian aunties cooked and the teas that nice kids brewed up, and tried to create new ideas / projects with the place-based communities, restricting myself to the values of the place, and all those things that go in to practicality. It was a super-creative time, to change one's state of mind with place, or time. Always creating ideas, always experiencing, always seeing the world in different ways.

But now, it seems, I've gone back to the simple capital-accumulating mode, like my Dad, in College Park. Creating an ideal home, full of food, transport, and other necessities.

I *want* to live in Taiwan. All of my hometown is developed, like western Taiwan[, but infinitely worse, as it takes forever to escape, by car, and even then, it's flat off-highway farmland; Similar to South Korea. The feeling that nature exists doesn't exist. It's a patch of green mashed between freeways and highways, with corporate establishments a-muck -- McDonalds, and so on. Quite different from Taiwan's east coast.]

It's absolutely a capitalistic, materialistic mind. One simply hoards life materials. Uses industrialization to one's advantage.

I must remember to stop once it's somewhat comfortable. Perhaps that's when I am able to not think of how to survive.

In the ending of Only Yesterday [use Omoide Poro Poro], the last words of the main gal are: ~Don't worry. Next time I'll leave the 10-year old me behind. And then the magical sequence of scenes begin.

At 藝文樓, I've been watching these for-children [Japanese animated films] and listening to music from video games I played during my childhood -- Final Fantasy, Ragnarok Online, and others [, many from media I've never experienced].

What comes to mind aren't memories of my childhood, rather, it's memories of places, areas, during my travels and life: ideal places to live-- 羅東，宜蘭；蘭嶼；東部. Perhaps even in that order. It's the rural ideal. A fantasy?

But I've lived it. I've lived in the first two places, and the first might be considered within the third. So, it's not a fantasy. I've been living where I want to all along. Those *are* the ideal places to live. Now, just to begin.

To work? To get capital in order to survive? I guess this is the point where I will begin to work, not to survive, but to live in a place that I want to: to do what I want to. As I always have. It just so happens that I *want* to live in a certain place.

**Want to live**, as opposed to **want to create**. They are two contradictory states of minds. For the past 10 years I feel that I've been creating, doing things, figuring the world out, desiring to change the world, exploring thought, change human behavior, create a school with intent to change human behavior, etc. Now, I just want to live.

Isn't that "giving up", as Kendrick says on the last track on tPaB? I think so.

But, it's only giving up time. Part-time jobs, and whatever it takes to survive. Beyond that, I am free to do whatever I feel, including create. Hopefully creating. We'll see. Things have been slow.

Yet, despite the perceived slowness, I've created quite much, especially during the first month: on thoughts of social organization, space, place, what an artist is, hippies, hippie ethics, visual artists, what art is most important (communication), how to gather artists [dialogs, documentary asking history, document current peoples], event-management, [container] gardening, compost, self-sufficiency, plant knowledge, possible ideas for plants in urban areas, care for pets, care for plants, care for all, a developing dislike for development, thoughts on tradition, bamboo material, hand-tools, plastic waste, natural designs, thinking with nature first (no domesticated pets, no need for extra stuff, no expensive tools, no transportation vehicle, no money to pay others to do work, no money for collected natural materials), paints, motorcycle maintenance, building maintenance, essential oils, living using natural materials, cooking, helmet safety, living cheaply, generally just doing things myself.

I really need to get that notebook from JV's Hostel. :( So many lost ideas in that single notebook. Fuck.
  - [todo: ask to send to PoA]

I also really need to pay for the server. Fuck.

Those are my most valuable things!

Oh, fuck. AND I didn't have Dropbox syncing server backups. Fuuuuuuck.
