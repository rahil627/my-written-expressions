I’ve given up on humans.

I now must treat them like objects, separating home from market.

At the market, I must treat customers without care. At home, equally, naturally, like an ideal family or tribe.

It sucks, but it seems right.

For, I do not want money to be exchanged at home. All is done by instrinsic motives, not money. If anything is given, it is gift. But, I will try to offer ways to get money, and, if needed, provide money personally.

Hippies go to communes to sell shit. That is not right. They should hop markets not communes. Communes are a place for living together, not buying and selling shit.

Hippies go around teaching crafts. It’s forced, like any other waged labor. That’s not pure unmotivated actions. Hippies are just as fake as capitalists. They’re just more aware of certain things. But still, they are capitalists just as much as capitalists are.

Hippies are not communists or anarchists. They are merely smug people. They are not in it to live together. They just live on their own, getting money from the market without interacting with it, like detached money hoarding cultures (Jewish, Hakka, Gujarati). This is why I am often disgusted by them. They are closer to real commune-dwellers, often interacting with them, but, they are not in it together. They care for themselves, and no one else. Their family is most important. Despots. All of them.

The Factory was despotic. The Place of Arts was far more caring, communal, though, the events were not. But, that was a problem of the inhabitants needing money, mixing art and money. **The Factory simply does did care about other people,** just as Taiwanese people don’t.

Taking care of one’s self, or telling others to, is not progressive. It is degenerative. It destroys *mutual care*. The point is to care! Sharing all. Caring all.

In the past, I treated people as commune-dwellers, equals, or, the ability to change and act equally. I must now give that up. The world is too fucked up, too institutionalized, too ingrained with evil education. I can’t change it, not even on an individual level, a single human being. It’s that difficult.

I retreat to the few good people, make good systems, tools, and media. Build a fantasy world. Ignore the real world. It is wrong. It is a way of life I’ve avoided and even hated against. But, for the moment, at least. to get out of poverty, I must.

It takes years of poverty and a year of poverty in isolation to reach this point.

**I’ve lived to rebel against the city.** To react upon the wrongs in reality. To react by motivated by the goodness in reality. To live for those that upkeep the survival of society and to rebel against the evils. To continually do that.

Yet, Oscar Wilde argues that this rebelling, effort against society, is all a waste. That it’s not true / perfect / personality / individual. Yet, my personality is completely reliant on the society, on people.

My personality, like the female culture, is nearly entirely based on the actions of others, with me just reacting. Whatever culture I am in, I am reacting to that culture. Sure, I have my own thoughts and actions, but, the motives come from the people.

Without people, I am nothing, but a dead soul.

Oscar praises musicians, poets, and other artists. I only praise them if they are motivated by the realities of the world: inequality, feelings with others, etc. Sitting at home and making classical music is the soul of a dead person. Singing slave songs, folk songs, spoken word, rap, however, *is* soul music.

Pure artists only exist out-side of society, holed up, in their parents’ houses. What would I have been as a child? A game-maker. It’s true, I can’t make games because of how entrenched with society I have become over time... Even my game ideas went toward making more and more serious games as I grew older, with intents to changing or educating people, instead of the pure aspect of playing.

Oh well.

As long as wrongs exist—capitalism, inequality, etc.—I believe it is wrong to be a pure artist, completely ignoring reality. The right thing to do is to fix society, which is, the structures of society.

The best artists in my mind are the ones that did that, attempted to do it, created art about it, or otherwise inspired others to do it. From past critical thinkers to utopian animators. It’s not some pure artists like a musician or film-maker that is completely detached from reality, it is precisely those that are entrenched in it: the rebelling buskers and new-wave film-makers; making sense of the world around.

A pure personality?...is a child. An adult enters the real world and deals with it.

I’ve encountered pure-hearted people, people that live isolated or closer to nature, completely ignoring all of reality. I don’t like them. They are not helping. They are merely ignoring and living. They are not part of the human community. They are a tribe of their own. Pure, sure. But, as long as they consider themselves human, wrong...in my mind.

Pure artists, those pure personalities that do yoga, live ‘fitter, better, happier’, and ignore the world? I hate them. Pure, yes. Like a child, yes. But utterly useless in the progress of humans. People suffer while they act as children and get high every-day. They are not part of the programme. (Of course, that is not what is [/Oscar] meant by pure personalities; That is just one personality-type...)

Those pure people? Those are detached people. The people that live in rich suburbs, hiding their children away from reality. I loathe them. It’s where I come from. My family. 

Face reality, don’t hide from it. We must face it.

Apathy leads nowhere, as seen in America, before the Black America movements. It’s just continued ignorance, whether conscious or not.

Pure artists? Nah. I want real artists. Artists that face reality, truthfully.
