A row with Sweta caused a thought:
How did suburban American society fail in educating her? I came to the conclusion that she has a kind of personality that can fail to learn everything, though having access (and privelege) to media and higher education. By failing to learn, I do not mean being unable to find a path and deeply learn of a subject. I mean failing reflect on the things one experience. She did not have a parental teaching figure to guide her education, no one to ask questions after consuming media or experiencing something. Iâ€™m unsure what she did after class from elementary school to college, but it must not have involved many reflections.

Somewhere, she failed to learn both humanities and natural sciences. Her view of concepts of human nature is based on the society she lives in. She failed to learn science, instead, relying on dogmatic beliefs.
