[The Sugar Daddies of Science]
Science, as a giant system, needs a lot of money, but individuals doing research experiments that don’t require much money don’t. And, with a little DIY could accomplish a lot. All of that, self-funded, just as any other artist is, by doing whatever work for money.

Yeah, science groups, like the academy of sciences or whatever, are / were linked to politics, but surely a ton of independent thinkers existed. Science, to Yuval, is limited to the institutionalized-complex: academia, research centers, military research, etc. Or, during the time of the explorers, expeditions funded by European governments. The independent explorers are skipped over by historians, as are billions of artists.

**Now, with crowd-funding, does it matter so much? Crowd-funding shifts the financial aqueducts, from the old route of government to people, to the new route of people to people. Basically, crowds are the new financial foundation.** Furthermore, **crowds, unlike states, are way more likely to fund projects that have no political or economic value, such as, arts.**

His example of two scientists with cow-related projects is great. Quite a bit of time of my life was wasted because I simply thought there would be someone, whether a foundation created by a person that seemed sane, NGOs, and even at two points in my life, academia, that might be sane enough to fund my dreams. Most of that time was wasted. What I got out of it was the writings of my dreams, in a form guided by grant guidelines. The only one that agreed was one who just wanted more of my money!—the top art school. **There is no hope in any of those foundations. They are all ancient.** **All of the hope, I believe, relies on crowd-funded, friend-group-funded (which is precisely where crowd-funding get its initial kick of funding), and personally-funded endevours.** Most works are personally-funded.

The old foundations should rightfully die and make way for the far more accurate, quantifiable crowd-funding. The old foundation-grantee system was rather random: Rich people created a foundation. Someone in it somehow chooses the projects. That’s where the money goes. **It all depended on the ideology of the people who have a say in where the money goes.**

**Now, as long as there are people out there with similar values willing to donate money to a project, it’s possible the project will be funded.** **Which means, just about any sort of project has the possibly to get funded.**

This is the current digital foundation. Just as digital market-places disrupted traditional, physical markets, so too do digital foundations. Why check the physical markets when you can check the world on eBay, or the world-store on Amazon? Well, there are physical reasons, but, otherwise, just order online! Similarly, why check old foundations when you can try crowd-funding?

“Angel investing” in Silicon Valley was quite a disruption too, even before crowd-funding really took off. Here, a bunch of rich technocrats directly invested in more technology. And so the feedback loop becomes: invest in technology, get money, invest... Even more simple than the science loop! As long as it gets money, the investors are happy. **There are no morals in Silicon Valley.** Hence, dreadful “games”, dreadful apps, and other dreadful technologies, such as those of the most dreadful Elon Musk. **Moral-less people just chasing money, destroying nature, taking advantage of the frail human psyche in every way possible to get more money, quantifying everything evermore.**

At least with science there was a check. In addition to getting money (economy), it often had a political interest. Funding war machines, sure, but also the rest of government functions, including health and security. With direct investors, there’s no check. It doesn’t have to do anything, except, make money!

**Crowd-funding is almost the opposite of direct investment. The crowd doesn’t get anything in return (save “rewards”). It’s not a investment, as in a stake of the project. It’s just money flowing into whatever people value. And that’s beautiful! That’s the ideal! Put your money exactly into the projects that you value, *directly*!** It may be one of the best inventions ever!

Or worst. Like Silicon Valley, the values of the funders still suck. Silicon Valley investors value money. If they value anything else, it comes *after* money. **The crowd’s, that is, the public’s values, though much better, really depends on their interests [at that moment]. And their interests depends on their culture. And that culture is American culture [at that moment]**, since America has the most people and most money using crowd-funding.

American culture is simultaneously beautiful and scary. It could potentially fund and over-fund anything, but most of the time, it’s quite predictable. Things that Americans love, such as an entertainment media—an old favorite film, game, toy, sci-fi book, etc.—will ensure that the makers’ new project will be funded. So, one has to play the popular game. Fund a new Goonies movie? Or anything from Nickelodeon? Sure, a million [dollars]. Fund a fine artist or social theorist? Far less people, if any.

A lot of it has to do with what’s on the mind of Americans at the moment (celebrities, Black American movement...) and marketing tactics. Nostalgia is easy bait. 90s anything. Thats prime traditional media turned internet generation—the generation that likely most used crowd-funding. Otherwise, **it’s usually just sheer consumerism interests.**

Moral projects are quite rare and receive far less than entertainment projects. **Moral projects are also extremely unevenly distributed [(I mean, it has to be. Not everyone is making crowd-funding projects for every project that they do)].** So, is it really better than the old foundations?

Hmmmm. Now, I’m not so sure.

Foundations are just old-thinking, but at least there were some quality assurance, good intentions, and guidelines in mind for each foundation, at times making decent choices. Crowd-funding is pop-thinking, and the American crowd is much more consumerist than moralist. The result is probably wild, with both the good and the bad, no filter. **It’s capitalism, no filter.**

Hmm.

It really depends on Americans’ culture, education, and attention span. That’s so scary. **It seems Plato’s problem still exists here: there has never been a philosopher in control. In this case, of where the money goes.** **And so, we’ve gone through 2000 or so years just to reach the same societal problem: the idiots are in control of society.** Ugh.
