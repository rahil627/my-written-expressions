I should understand how to communicate with them, yet I truly don’t. I am able to get along with aboriginals quite well, especially 蘭嶼 culture; But some rural Tainanese people I’ve encountered are extremely conservative-minded, short-tempered, and sometimes even enjoy yelling and fighting, often abusing their power when in powerful positions (parents, boss, police, etc.). To be clear, I do not mean just being rude, I mean being moral-less, inequal, un-caring assholes.
