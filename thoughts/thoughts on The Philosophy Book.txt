Most attention toward belief in God and interpretations of scriptures (Torah, Q'ran, Bible). Mostly stupid arguments of God metaphysics, of beginning of universe, existence of God, etc.

It leads to some ontology problems (mind / body thought experiment by Avicenna, theory of knowledge by Aquinas, etc.), but very little.

Avicenna seems interesting for his Aristotle responses, and his life and writings as a physician and political advisor for princes.
