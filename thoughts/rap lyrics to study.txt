**I bomb atomically 
Socrates’ philosophies and hypotheses 
Can’t define how I be droppin’ these mockeries 
Lyrically perform armed robbery 
Flee with the lottery 
Possibly they spotted me 
Battle-scarred shogun, explosion when my pen hits 
Tremendous, ultra-violet shine blind forensics 
I inspect you, through the future see millennium 
Killer Bees sold fifty gold sixty platinum 
Shacklin’ the masses with drastic rap tactics 
Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths 
Black Wu jackets queen B’s ease the guns in 
Rumble with patrolmen, tear gas laced the function 
Heads by the score take flight incite a war 
Chicks hit the floor, die hard fans demand more 
Behold the bold soldier, control the globe slowly 
Proceeds to blow swingin’ swords like Shinobi 
Stomp grounds and pound footprints in solid rock 
Wu got it locked, performing live on your hottest block**



**Visualizin the realism of life and actuality 
Fuck who’s the baddest a person’s status depends on salary 
And my mentality is, money orientated**
I’m destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it 
cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as five percenters 
But somethin must of got in us cause all of us turned to sinners 
Now some, restin in peace and some are sittin in San Quentin 
Others such as myself are tryin to carry on tradition 
Keepin the schwepervesence street ghetto essence inside us 
Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us 
Even though, we know somehow we all gotta go 
but as long as we leavin thievin we’ll be leavin with some kind of dough 
so, and to that day we expire and turn to vapors 
me and my capers-ll be somewhere stackin plenty papers 
**Keepin it real, packin steel, gettin high 
Cause life’s a bitch and then you die**

Live at the BBQ 

Nas 

Street’s disciple, my raps are trifle 
I shoot slugs from my brain just like a rifle 
Stampede the stage, I leave the microphone split 
Play Mr. Tuffy while I’m on some Pretty Tone shit 
Verbal assassin, my architect pleases 
When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin Jesus 
Nasty Nas is a rebel to America 
Police murderer, I’m causin hysteria 
My troops roll up with a strange force 
I was trapped in a cage and let out by the Main Source 
Swimmin in women like a lifeguard 
Put on a bulletproof nigga I strike hard 
Kidnap the President’s wife without a plan 
And hangin niggaz like the Ku Klux Klan 
I melt mics till the sound waves over 
Before steppin to me you’d rather step to Jehovah 
Slammin MC’s on cement 
Cause verbally, I’m iller than a AIDS patient 
I move swift and uplift 
your mind shoot the gift when I riff in rhyme 
Rappin sniper, speakin real words 
My thoughts react, like Steven Spielberg’s 
Poetry attacks, paragraphs punch hard 
My brain is insane, I’m out to lunch God 
Science is dropped, my raps are toxic 
My voicebox locks and excels like a rocket

**So what do you say to somebody you hate 
Or anybody tryna bring trouble your way 
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way 
Just study your tape of NWA.**
One day I was walkin by 
With a walkmen on 
When I caught a guy givin me an awkward eye 
And strangled him off in the parkin lot with his Karl Kani 
I don’t give a fuck if it’s dark or not 
I’m harder than me tryna park a Dodge 
But I’m drunk as fuck 
Right next to a humungous truck in a two car garage 
Hoppin out with two broken legs tryna walk it off 
Fuck you too bitch call the cops 
I’ma kill you and them loud ass muthafuckin barkin dogs 
And when the cops came through 
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house 
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches 
And still weren’t found out 
From here on out it’s the Chronic 2 
Startin today and tomorrows the new 
And I’m still loco enough 
To choke you to death with a Charleston chew 
[Record scratch] 
**Slim shady hotter then a set of twin babies 
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up 
And the temp goes up to the mid 80’s 
Callin men ladies
Sorry Doc but I been crazy 
There is no way that you can save me 
It’s ok go with him Hailey**

Dead Presidents II 

1st verse 



Ahh, who wanna bet us that we don’t touch leathers 
Stack cheddars forever, live treacherous all the et ceteras 
**To the death of us, me and my confidants, we shine 
You feel the ambiance, y’all niggaz just rhyme**
By the ounce dough accumulates like snow 
We don’t just shine, we illuminate the whole show; you feel me? 
Factions from the other side would love to kill me 
Spill three quarts of my blood into the street, let alone the heat 
**Fuck em, we hate a nigga lovin this life 
In all possible ways, know the Feds is buggin my life**
**Hospital days, reflectin when my man laid up 
On the Uptown high block he got his side sprayed up 
I saw his life slippin, this is a minor set back 
Yo, still in all we livin, just dream about the get back 
That made him smile though his eyes said, “Pray for me” 
I’ll do you one better and slay these niggaz faithfully**
Murder is a tough thing to digest, it’s a slow process 
and I ain’t got nothin but time 
I had near brushes, not to mention three shots 
close range, never touched me, divine intervention 
Can’t stop I, from drinkin Mai-Tai’s, with Ta Ta 
Down in Nevada, ha ha, Poppa, word life 
**I dabbled in crazy weight without rap, I was crazy straight 
Potnah, I’m still spendin money from eighty-eight... what?**


The Great Adventures of Slick Rick

The Great Adventures of Slick Rick (1988)
Children’s Story 

Here we go, 
Once upon a time not long ago, 
When people wore pajamas and lived life slow, 
When laws were stern and justice stood, 
And people were behavin’ like they ought ta good, 
There lived a lil’ boy who was misled, 
By anotha lil’ boy and this is what he said: 
“Me & You, Ty, we gonna make sum cash, 
Robbin’ old folks and makin’ da dash”, 
They did the job, money came with ease, 
But one couldn’t stop, it’s like he had a disease, 
He robbed another and another and a sista and her 
Brotha, 
Tried to rob a man who was a D.T. undercover, 
The cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic, 
He said “Keep still, boy, no need for static”, 
Punched him in his belly and he gave him a slap, 
But little did he know the lil’ boy was strapped, 
The kid pulled out a gun, he said “Why’d ya hit me?”, 
The barrel was set straight for the cop’s kidney, 
The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure, 
“I’ll do years if I pull this trigga”, 
So he cold dashed and ran around the block, 
Cop radioes it to another lady cop, 
He ran by a tree, there he saw this sista, 
A shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her, 
Looked around good and from expectations, 
So he decided he’d hit for the subway stations, 
But she was coming and he made a left, 
He was runnin’ top speed till he was outta breath, 
Knocked an old man down and swore he killed him,(sorry) 
Then he made his move to an abandoned building, 
Ran up the stairs up to the top floor, 
Opened up the door there, guess who he saw?, 
Dave the dope fiend shootin’ dope, 
Who don’t know the meaning of water nor soap, 
He said(I need bullets, hurry up, run) 
The dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun, 
He went outside but there was cops all over, 
Then he dipped into a car, a stolen Nova, 
Raced up the block doing 83, 
Crashed into a tree near university, 
Escaped alive though the car was battered, 
Rat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered, 
Ran out of bullets and still had static, 
Grabbed a pregnant lady and pulled out the automatic, 
Pointed at her head and he said the gun was full o’ lead, 
He told the cops(Back off or honey here’s dead), 
Deep in his heart he knew he was wrong, 
So he let the lady go and he starts to run on, 
Sirens sounded, he seemed astounded, 
Before long the lil’ boy got surrounded, 
He dropped the gun, so went the glory, 
And this is the way I have to end this story, 
He was only seventeen, in a madman’s dream, 
**The cops shot the kid, I still hear him scream,**
This ain’t funny so don’t ya dare laugh, 
Just another case about the wrong path, 
Straight ‘n narrow or yo’ soul gets CAST. 

Good Night.

N.Y. State of Mind 

1st verse 


Rappers I monkey flip em with the funky rhythm I be kickin 
Musician, inflictin composition 
of pain I’m like Scarface sniffin cocaine 
Holdin a M-16, see with the pen I’m extreme, now 
Bulletholes left in my peepholes 
I’m suited up in street clothes 
Hand me a nine and I’ll defeat foes 
Y’all know my steelo with or without the airplay 
I keep some E&J, sittin bent up in the stairway 
Or either on the corner bettin Grants with the celo champs 
Laughin at baseheads, tryin to sell some broken amps 
G-Packs get off quick, forever niggaz talk shit 
Remeniscing about the last time the Task Force flipped 
Niggaz be runnin through the block shootin 
Time to start the revolution, catch a body head for Houston 
Once they caught us off guard, the Mac-10 was in the grass and 
I ran like a cheetah with thoughts of an assassin 
Pick the Mac up, told brothers, “Back up,” the Mac spit 
Lead was hittin niggaz one ran, I made him backflip 
Heard a few chicks scream my arm shook, couldn’t look 
Gave another squeeze heard it click yo, my shit is stuck 
Try to cock it, it wouldn’t shoot now I’m in danger 
Finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber 
So now I’m jetting to the building lobby 
and it was filled with children probably couldn’t see as high as I be 
(So whatchu sayin?) **It’s like the game ain’t the same 
Got younger niggaz pullin the triggers bringing fame to they name 
and claim some corners, crews without guns are goners**
In broad daylight, stickup kids, they run up on us 
Fo’-fives and gauges, Macs in fact 
Same niggaz’ll catch a back to back, snatchin yo’ cracks in black 
There was a snitch on the block gettin niggaz knocked 
So hold your stash until the coke price drop 
I know this crackhead, who said she gotta smoke nice rock 
And if it’s good she’ll bring ya customers in measuring pots, but yo 
You gotta slide on a vacation 
Inside information keeps large niggaz erasin and they wives basin 
**It drops deep as it does in my breath 
I never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death**
**Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined 
I think of crime when I’m in a New York state of mind**

Shook Ones part II 

Prodigy 

I got you stuck off the realness, we be the infamous 
you heard of us 
official Queensbridge murderers 
the Mobb comes equipped with warfare, beware 
of my crime family who got nuff shots to share 
for all of those who wanna profile and pose 
rock you in your face, stab your brain wit’ your nosebone 
you all alone in these streets, cousin 
every man for theirself in this land we be gunnin’ 
and keep them shook crews runnin’ 
like they supposed to 
they come around but they never come close to 
I can see it inside your face 
you’re in the wrong place 
cowards like you just get they’re whole body laced up 
with bullet holes and such 
speak the wrong words man and you will get touched 
you can put your whole army against my team and 
I guarantee you it’ll be your very last time breathin’ 
your simple words just don’t move me 
you’re minor, we’re major 
you all up in the game and don’t deserve to be a player 
don’t make me have to call your name out 
your crew is featherweight 
my gunshots’ll make you levitate 
**I’m only nineteen but my mind is old 
and when the things get for real my warm heart turns cold 
another nigga deceased, another story gets told 
it ain’t nothin’ really 
hey, yo dun spark the Phillie**
so I can get my mind off these yellowbacked niggas 
why they still alive I don’t know, go figure 
meanwhile back in Queens the realness is foundation 
if I die I couldn’t choose a better location 
when the slugs penetrate you feel a burning sensation 
getting closer to God in a tight situation 
**now, take these words home and think it through 
or the next rhyme I write might be about you**

1st verse 


Who shot ya? 
Seperate the weak from the ob-solete 
Hard to creep them Brooklyn streets 
It’s on nigga, fuck all that bickering beef 
I can hear sweat trickling down your cheek 
Your heartbeat soun like Sasquatch feet 
Thundering, shaking the concrete 
Finish it, stop, when I foil the plot 
Neighbors call the cops said they heard mad shots 
Saw me in the drop, three and a quarter 
Slaughter, electrical tape around your daughter 
Old school new school need to learn though 
I burn baby burn like Disco Inferno 
Burn slow like blunts with ya-yo 
Peel more skins than Idaho potato 
Niggaz know, the lyrics molestin is takin place 
Fuckin with B.I.G. it ain’t safe 
I make your skin chafe, rashes on the masses 
Bumps and bruises, blunts and Landcruisers 
Big Poppa smash fools, bash fools 
Niggaz mad because I know that Cash Rules 
Everything Around Me, two glock nines 
Any motherfucker whispering about mines 
And I’m, Crooklyn’s finest 
You rewind this, Bad Boy’s behind this

Can I Live 

1st verse 

While I’m watchin every nigga watchin me closely 
my shit is butter for the bread they wanna toast me 
**I keep my head, both of them where they supposed to be**
Hoes’ll get you sidetracked then clap from closed feet 
I don’t sleep, I’m tired, I feel wired like codeine, these days 
a brother gotta admire from four fiends away 
My pain wish it was quick to see, from sellin ‘caine 
til brains was fried to a fricaisse, can’t lie 
At the time it never bothered me, at the bar 
gettin my thug on properly, my squad and me 
lack of respect for authority, laughin hard 
**Happy to be escapin poverty, however brief**
I know this game got valleys and peaks, expectation 
for dips, four percent pertation we stack chips, hardly 
The youth I used to be, soon to see a mill’in 
No more, Big Willie my game has grown prefer you call me William 
Illin for revenues, Rayful Edmonds like 
Channel 7 news, round seven jewels, hand gettin the mic 
Forgettin all I ever knew, convenient amnesia 
**I suggest you call my lawyer, I know the procedure 
Lock my body can’t trap my mind, easily 
explain why we adapt to crime**
**I’d rather die enormous than live dormant that’s how we on it**
Live at the main event, I bet a trip to Maui on it 
Presidential suites my resedential for the weekend 
Confidentially speakin in codes since I sense you peekin 
The NSX rental, don’t be fooled my game is mental 
We both out of town dog, what you tryin to get into? 
Viva, Las Vegas, see ya, later at the crap tables 
meet me by the one that starts a G up 
This way no fraud Willie’s present gambling they re-up 
And we can have a pleasant time, sippin margaritas 
Ge-ge-geyeahhh, can I live? 
Can I live?


Paid In Full

Paid In Full (1987)
Paid in Full 

Thinkin of a master plan 
Cuz ain’t nuthin but sweat inside my hand 
So I dig into my pocket, all my money is spent 
So I dig deeper but still comin up with lint 
**So I start my mission- leave my residence 
Thinkin how could I get some dead presidents
I need money, I used to be a stick-up kid 
So I think of all the devious things I did 
I used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain’t nuthin funny 
Stop smiling, be still, don’t nuthin move but the money 
But now I learned to earn cos I’m righteous 
I feel great! so maybe I might just 
Search for a 9 to 5, if I strive 
Then maybe I’ll stay alive
So I walk up the street whistlin this 
Feelin out of place cos, man, do I miss 
A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of 
Me and eric b, and a nice big plate of 
Fish, which is my favorite dish 
But without no money it’s still a wish 
Cos I don’t like to dream about gettin paid 
So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I made 
To now test to see if I got pull 
Hit the studio, cos I’m paid in full**

C.R.E.A.M. 

Inspectah Deck 

It’s been twenty-two long hard years of still strugglin 
**Survival got me buggin, but I’m alive on arrival
I peep at the shape of the streets 
And stay awake to the ways of the world cause shit is deep**
**A man with a dream with plans to make C.R.E.A.M. 
Which failed; I went to jail at the age of 15**
A young buck sellin drugs and such who never had much 
Trying to get a clutch at what I could not... could not... 
The court played me short, now I face incarceration 
Pacin — going up state’s my destination 
Handcuffed in back of a bus, forty of us 
Life as a shorty shouldn’t be so ruff 
**But as the world turns I learned life is hell 
Living in the world no different from a cell**
Everyday I escape from Jakes givin chase, sellin base 
Smokin bones in the staircase 
Though I don’t know why I chose to smoke sess 
I guess that’s the time when I’m not depressed 
But I’m still depressed, and I ask what’s it worth? 
**Ready to give up so I seek the Old Earth 
Who explained working hard may help you maintain 
to learn to overcome the heartaches and pain**
**We got stickup kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks 
and stray shots, all on the block that stays hot**
**Leave it up to me while I be living proof 
To kick the truth to the young black youth**
But shorty’s running wild smokin sess drinkin beer 
And ain’t trying to hear what I’m kickin in his ear 
Neglected, but now, but yo, it gots to be accepted 
That what? That life is hectic

Nas 

**Through the lights cameras and action, glamour glitters and gold 
I unfold the scroll, plant seeds to stampede the globe 
When I’m deceased, by then the beast arise like yeast 
to conquer peace leaving savages to roam in the streets**
Live on the run, police paying me to give in my gun 
Trick my Wisdom, with the system that imprisoned my son 
Smoke a gold leaf I hold heat, nonchalantly 
I’m grungy, but things I do is real it never haunts me 
while, funny style niggaz roll in the pile 
Rooster heads profile on a bus to Riker’s Isle 
Holdin weed inside they pussy with they minds on the 
pretty things in life, props is a true thug’s wife 
**It’s like a cycle, niggaz come home, some’ll go in 
Do a bullet, come back, do the same shit again 
From the womb to the tomb, presume the unpredictable 
Guns salute life, rapidly, that’s the ritual**

Eminem - 1st verse 

Since I’m in a position to talk to these kids and they listen 
I ain’t no politician, but I’ll kick it with ‘em a minute 
Cause, see, they call me a menace, and if the shoe fits I’ll wear it 
But if it don’t, then y’all’ll swallow the truth, grin and bear it 
Now who’s the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics? 
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics? 
Using his music to steer it, sharing his views and his merits 
But there’s a huge interference: they’re saying you shouldn’t hear it 
Maybe it’s hatred I spew, maybe it’s food for the spirit 
Maybe it’s beautiful music I made for you to just cherish 
But I’m debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America 
As a motherfuckin’ drug addict - like you didn’t experiment? 
Now now, that’s when you start to stare at who’s in the mirror 
And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed 
And I got nothing to do but make you look stupid as parents 
You fuckin’ do-gooders, too bad you couldn’t do good at marriage 
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here? I don’t 
Think you do, so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo 
Cause here we go, he’s {*Jigga j-Jigga*} 
And I’m the sinister Mr. Kiss-My-Ass, it’s just the

In The Commision, you ask for permission to hit em 
He don’t like me, him and wild wifey was wit em 
You heard of us, the murderers, most shady 
Been on the low lately, the feds hate me 
The son of *Satan*, they say my killin’s too blatant 
You hesitatin, I’m in your mama crib waitin 
Duct tapin, your fam destiny 
lays in my hands, gat lays in my waist 
Francis, M to the iz-H phenominal 
Gun rest under your vest by the abdominal 
Rhyme a few bars so I can buy a few cars 
And I kick a few flows so I can pimp a few hoes 
Excellence is my presence, never tense 
**Never hesitant, leave a nigga bent real quick 
Real sick, brawl nights, I perform like Mike 
Anyone — Tyson, Jordan, Jackson 
action, pack guns, ridiculous 
And I’m, quick to bust, if my ends you touch 
Kids or girl you touch, in this world I clutch 
Two auto-matoes, used to call me fatso 
Now you call me Castro, my rap flows 
militant, y’all faggots ain’t killin shit**
Ooops Cristal keep spillin shit, **you overdid it homes 
You in the danger zone, you shouldn’t be alone** 
Hold hands and say it like me

Yo, fuck all the glamours and glitz, I plan to get rich 
I’m from new york and never was a fan of the knicks 
And I’m all about expandin my chips 
You mad cause I was in the van with your bitch 
With both hands on her tits 
Corleone hold the throne, that you know in your heart 
I got style, plus the way that I be flowin is sharp 
A while back I used to hustle, sellin blow in the park 
Countin g stacks and rockin ice that glow in the dark 
Forever, hottie huntin, trigger temper I’m quick to body somethin 
You lookin at me like I’m probably frontin 
I fuck around and throw, three in your chest and flee to my rest 
I’m, older and smarter this is me at my best 
I stopped hangin around y’all, cause niggaz like you 
Be prayin on my downfall, hopin I flop 
Hopin I stop, you probably even hope I get locked 
Or be on the street corner with a pipe, smokin the rock 
I got more riches than you, fuck more bitches than you 
Only thing I haven’t got is more, stitches than you 
Fuckin punk, you ain’t a leader what? nobody followed you 
You was never shit, **your mother shoulda swallowed you** 
You on some tagalong flunkie yes man shit 
Do me a favor, please get off the next man dick 
And if you think I can’t fuck with whoever, put your money up 
Put your jewels up, no fuck it put your honey up 
Put your raggedy house up nigga, or shut your mouth up 
Before I buck lead, and make a lot of blood shed 
Turn your tux red, I’m far from broke, got enough bread 
And mad hoes, **ask beavis I get nuttin butt-head**
My game is, vicious and cruel 
Fuckin chicks is a rule 
If my girl think I’m loyal then that bitch is a fool 
How come, you can listen to my first album 
And tell where a lot of niggaz got they whole style from? 
So what you actin for? 
You ain’t half as raw, you need to practice more 
Somebody tell this nigga sum’un, ‘fore I crack his jaw 
You runnin with boys, I’m runnin with men 
I’ma be rippin the mics until I’m a hundred and ten 
Have y’all niggaz like, ‘damnit this nigga done done it again’ 
I throw slugs at idi-ots, no love for city cops 
I sport a pretty watch, eight-hundred and fifty rocks 
I’m makin wonderful figures 
I don’t fuck with none of you niggaz 
I might pull out this gun on your niggaz 
And rob every last one of you niggaz

Scarface 

2nd verse 

**Day by day it’s more impossible to cope 
I feel like I’m the one that’s doing dope 
Can’t keep a steady hand because I’m nervous 
Every sunday morning I’m in service 
Playing for forgiveness 
And trying to find an exit out of the business 
I know the lord is looking at me 
But yet and still it’s hard for me to feel happy 
I often drift while I drive 
Havin fatal thoughts of suicide 
Bang and get it over with 
And then I’m worry-free, but that’s bullshit 
I got a little boy to look after 
And if I died then my child would be a bastard 
I had a woman down with me 
But to me it seemed like she was down to get me 
She helped me out in this shit 
But to me she was just another bitch 
Now she’s back with her mother 
Now I’m realizing that I love her 
Now I’m feeling lonely 
My mind is playing tricks on me**

**Yo I got slugs for snitches 
No love for bitches 
Putting thugs in ditches 
When my trigger finger itches 
I got a rep that make police jet 
Known to get a priest wet 
I never beg for pussy like Keith Sweat**
Is Big L slow, hell no 
**Bitches get fucked on the roof when I ain’t got no hotel do’**
I’m known for yoking jacks 
And beating them with smoking gats 
**Leaving token Blacks with broken backs and open caps**
So with that bullshit, step to the rear son 
The last thing you want with Big L is a fair one 
Cause in a street brawl, I strike men like lightning 
You see what happened in my last fight friend, aight then 
**I beat kids with lead pipes 
I leave a trail of dead mic’s
Where I’m from, niggas jewels get ran like red lights**
**Old folks get mugged and raided, crimes are drug related 
And we live by the street rules that thugs created**
Clowns get smoked about a thousand folks for selling pounds of coke 
Front in this town and get a tech stuck down your throat 
I’m telling you shit is about to get drastic soon 
I’m quick to blast a goon and break a motherfucker like a plastic spoon 
**I got the looks that make your hotty stare 
I keep a shotty near 
It’s the nigga with notty hair who Gotti fear**
Tracks I’m know to roast until the microphone is ghost 
Props I own the most 
I’m leaving niggas comatose 
Front and get your brain pinched 
Big L will have your whole gang lynched 
I started smoking dust and been insane since 
This rap shit was a great gift 
The other night some snake riffed and got a hot lead face lift 
All through high school I had braids 
I kept mad blades 
Stabbing teachers to death that gave me bad grades 
I cook the mic like a beef steak 
Cause my technique’s great 
And I’m the nigga police hate in each state 
Cause I’m the neighborhood lamper 
Punk brother vamper 
Fuck around you’ll find my silk boxers in your mother’s hamper 
Cops drop when my Glock makes a pow sound 
I’m from a wild town 
You know my style clown, so bow down
