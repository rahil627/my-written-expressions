# Discourse? vs Discord?
should a Discourse forums be created for all of the digital organizations? wouldn’t that just create another messy knowledge base, in which you’d have to go in to extract data from?

if you were to use one, you’d have to maintain it well to keep a clean knowledge-base

Discourse is a less human, less interactive form of communication, though, it being time-independent does make it more convenient. ...but in Discord, you can chat to people independent of time too, just use the @mention.

Hmmm... Discourse still has it’s uses: for directed conversation, dialectics, topic-based discussions... Discord can feel like a mess of people, just saying whatever they want, whereas Discourse keeps communication on topic. It’s a lot more functional.

I think Discourse could be useful for any digital organization.

names for digital communities:
FGA - fighting game anarchy
EGA - experimental game anarchy
TFA - tech/tools for anarchy

put your name in it!:
rathewolf’s fighting game anarchy
rathewolf’s experiemtnal game anarchy
rathewolf’s tech/tools for anarchy

this makes it easy to search, and displays the human behind the work

use an informal name, like the Factory or the Retro Room:
rathewolf’s garage / street / back-yard / cul-de-sac
rathewolf’s arcade / laboratory / **exploratorium**
rathewolf’s garden / temple

but still keep the full name:
rathewolf’s garage: a fighting game anarchy

choosing a digital name:
ra
ra the wolf
**rathewolf**
ra-the-wolf
Ra-The-Wolf

ra and ‘ra the wolf’ are difficult to search for on the internet. Single, unique words are better.

i believe hyphens too are ignored by search enngines

that simply leaves rathewolf
