  - ...other creative / making digital tools (music, film, film essay, etc.)
    - music - MIDI, busking
    - film essay? whoa
  - bookmark reading / consuming app, like Pocket
  - functional apps like Devine’s (vi/emacs aesthetic interface)
   - to make work-flows really minimal, creative-inducing

  - media frameworks (SDL, oF, Kha, etc.)
some examples ‘n ideas:
  - interactive / digital art ideas
    - input devices / sensors, strange outputs, etc.
    - very basic games that don’t need a game engine, since most of the work is on the input and output
  - device camera graphics apps

  - fighting game anarchy crowd-sourced community knowledge-base
  - JRPG-like text display for my own site

    - able to mod?
  - 2D playground / sandbox

    - better to start with a game with a bunch of assets (weapons, movement skills) to play around with, like Dead Cells
