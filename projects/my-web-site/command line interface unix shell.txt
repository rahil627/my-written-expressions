from wiki for ‘shell’:
In computing, a shell is a computer program which exposes an operating system's services to a human user or other programs. In general, operating system shells use either a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI), depending on a computer's role and particular operation. It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating system.[1][2]

from wiki for bash:
bash is the unix shell used in most linux OSes, including mac os (until 2019, when it switched to szh shell)
