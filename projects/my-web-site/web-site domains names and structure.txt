# domain names (top-level)
rahilpatel.com
  - current, and, for 10 years, just keep it forever
  - todo: should try to sell it
  - https://www.namecheap.com/blog/how-to-sell-your-domains/
  - only sells for around $100

x/rahil.org
  - until I can get rahil.com
  - update: i let this go..
rathewolf.com
  - new personal site
  - sub-domains: mind, body, soul...
willowolf.com
  - new public-facing site, as an extension of my personal ideas, ideals, wills
  - cuter, easier to create cute willowolf species for each project
  - (www.)willowolf.com, is just a listing of projects (sub-domains)
  - sub-domains: fighting, experimental, nature(?), search...


scratched ideas:
wolfoftheway.com
  - not as personal or cute as Ra, the Wolf, but the meaning is perfect
  - also has sub-domain flexibility just as willowolf does
  - **worth buying!** much better than rahilpatel.com
wayofthewolf.com
  - not as catchy or spiritual as Will o’ Wolf

# dns routing
ideally:
host the entire site in one place, on one server, using one cms, then, set the dns handler and server (apache virtualhost, or through plesk/cpanel)to route the sub-domains to the site.

github pages set-up:
let’s say you have a site on (www.)willowolf.com, then
set the dns and server to route fighting.willowolf.com(/*) to willowolf.com/fighting(/*): that is, from fighting.willowolf.com(/*) to rahil627.github.io(/[repo-name])?

i’m not sure if you can do that...
