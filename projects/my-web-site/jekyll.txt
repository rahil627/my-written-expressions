# vs Hugo:
https://cloudcannon.com/blog/jekyll-vs-hugo-choosing-the-right-tool-for-the-job/
  - about the same amount of users, but Hugo rose quickly
    - https://star-history.com/#jekyll/jekyll
  - more extendable, has plugins (Ruby gems)
  - more readable / easier to comprehend (because Go and Hugo’s templating system is cryptic)
  - slower


https://pages.github.com/versions/
  - can see GitHub Pages’s installation of Jekyll here, listing it’s plugins ‘n dependencies
  - can also see which themes are already installed

## notes:

config:
remote_theme: jekyll/minima # force remote download to get the most recent version, which has skins, because GitHub Pages doesn’t update them often
remote_theme: rahil627/minima-custom-jekyll-theme # i won't ever rememeber to update my forked version :(

  - find some themes on github with the topic of ‘jekyll-theme’

https://ben.balter.com/jekyll-style-guide/themes/
  - changing the fonts ‘n style stuff is easy, just change the scss file (like a new css file); so, don’t worry if the style suck, as long the the site ‘n page formats are fine

## themes
https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#overriding-theme-defaults

### starter / barebones themes
by starting with the most simplest themes of the style / layout, can then learn by practice and build a page

from the simplest to the most complex:
primer
  - possibly **the most primitive, bare-bones**, the layouts (pages, posts, home) are just empty placeholders

riggraz/no-style-please
  - **a very special nearly css-less style, has its own raw html beauty**

kotet/ultralight
  - another no css theme, less centered, smaller font

ghosind/Jekyll-Paper
  - good for reading, very basic, **looks great on an iPad, cramming the entire screen**

jekyll-now
  - **basic single column page** with a **basic top nav bar**, making it a very good place to start

reverie:
  - forked from jekyll-now, quite perfect for the single-column top nav bar style

minimal
  - quite popular, **changes view when the device is on it’s side**, which is really neat, putting the nav bar on the left side when horizontal and at the top when vertical, very very smooth

BDHU / minimalist
  - someone’s fork of minimal, hard-coded nav-bar though, colors similar to minima’s dark skin

jekyll/minima
  - the default for jekyll but still should be used with remote_theme toget the latest version, has 4 skins: dark, **solarized is book-like**, solarized-dark is kinda ugly, and the default white one
    - **the solarized one can be used for rathewolf.com**
  - **this theme has a lot problems**: because it does SEO stuff “under the hood”, such as getting the ‘title’ and ‘description’ vars from the GitHub repo’s project name and description

x/minimal mistakes
  - most popular, two-column, but quite heavy on features, more for people that just want a site and don’t want to do the work to build one themselves

### special purpose themes:
ronv/sidey
  - fantastic for it’s style: **two-column**, also a fantastic minimal listing of posts! wow, very very good, **great for lots of writings**, like **a mix of a documentation site and a blog**, **can try putting ‘the mind of ra the wolf’ project here!!!!**
yous/whiteglass

sighingnow/jekyll-gitbook
  - pretty awesome **two column book / documentation** style, with **table of contents expanding on the side**, making it easier to navigate longer writings
  - **contains a deep search plugin that can quickly search all text!** :o
  - uses **jekyll-toc table of contents plugin**

b2a3e8/jekyll-theme-console
  - terminal-like, 3 skins including: a black ‘n white terminal which resembles **ascii art**, **the matrix green one, very fun!**, and a normal white-background black font one
  - the default black one is **good for experimental games anarchy** lol

the windows 95 theme
  - omg!!! :o

### to steal ideas, colors, fonts from:
Hammie217/LatexJekyll
  - **reads like a newspaper**, good padding, serif font

https://github.com/erlzhang/jekyll-theme-persephone
  - comes with many layouts that are all beautiful

piharpi/jekyll-klise
  - nice bolds ‘n off-colors, awesome **light / dark toggle switch**, the dark skin has very **molokai-like style**
  - **good enough for my personal site, for now...**
  - navigation menu is pop-up
  - requires an icon? also content comes quite far down...

poole/lanyon
  -  minimal grey, quite popular, solid, must click a button to reveal a side-bar (“drawer”), but, i think it wastes time and an extra click

chesterhow/tale
  - minimal grey

huangyz0918/moving
  - super minimal grey, **like my original Wordpress theme**

nielsenramon/chalk
  - minimal black ‘n white

daviddarnes/alembic
  - boiler-plate site meant to be used as a base, minimal grey, **maybe should start with this one, if intend to edit it myself**

sharu725/hagura
  - minimal grey, huge titles ‘n fonts, **like medium.com**, really great for sites that don’t have much,, **dark ‘n light toggle**, though, the dark-side isn’t very pretty


am i limited to just the themes by GitHub Pages?
  - https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll#further-reading
    - set remote_theme
  - can use any theme found on gitHub, the value is [user-name]/[theme name]
  - see https://github.com/topics/jekyll-theme
  - try these themes: 'poole/lanyon', and the 'dark' and solarized' skins of minima

in _config.yml file:
#theme: jekyll-theme-tactile # this only works for the themes that github pages has installed, and, they are all very old

remote_theme: poole/lanyon #  use this method

plugins: jekyll-remote-theme # github pages must already have this...

minima: # some themes provide color variants
  skin: dark #solarized
