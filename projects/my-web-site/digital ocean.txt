add a droplet
use the image of Ubuntu (most recent) with Plesk or cPanel


add domains:
select networking from the main menu
can add all of the domains here
  - might as well add all of them, instead of dividing the service between domain registrar and web-host; anyway, digital ocean has a far superior interface compared to namecheap
can set records here (re-directs, etc.)
will have to go to domain registrar (namecheap) to set nameservers to point to digital cloud



domain migration info:
wildcard re-direct (all sub-domains) to [base url]
  - not exactly sure how this works...
re-direct [base url] to www.[base url]
  - not really needed, is it?
catch-all e-mail and re-direct to my gmail

# dns records from namecheap domains
the first four records are for GitHub pages
  - type: A record / host: @ / value: 185.199.108.153/ ttl: Automatic
  - 185.199.108.153
  - 185.199.109.153
  - 185.199.110.153
  - 185.199.111.153
the last record is for ‘Positive SSL’ (by Comodo), which Namecheap gave out for free 
  - CAA Record / rathewolf.com / 0 issue “comodoca.com” / Automatic
during the previous year i renewed the domain.
  - i don’t need this as i will use DigitalOcean which handles SSL more conveniently, and for free!
