# wordpress recovery notes

# post-recovery, preparing for export
clean-up installation before backing up:
users:
settings, general, uncheck ‘anyone can register’
  - why the fuck does this exist?
download some plugin (WP Bulk Delete) to help delete all users with the ‘subscriber’ role
  - can also use that plugin to clean old slugs ‘n orphaned things


# recovery
for some reason, Wordpress UpdraftPlus backup plugin wasn’t working... luckily, the backups were a zipped mysql database file and zipped folders of the contents of wordpress-home/wp-content directory:
themes
plugins
uploads
...?
“others” for all files in this directory

check version of Wordpress
  - two methods: database or file
  - the version number in the database must be cross-referenced at [get wordpress codex version link]; for example. 45805 = 5.3.01 to 5.3.10
install the correct version of Wordpress (using Plesk)
  - ensure database table prefix is the same as in the backup
  - ensure the admin username and password are the same
    - if not, Plesk will give an error or warning about the admin credential not working
    - can change this in the database under the ‘users’ table
      - go to database, phpmyadmin, and change it in there
  - leave the database user-name and password fields as is—auto-generated; they are automatically set in the wp-config file
  - wait for this to finish in Plesk; don’t go to another tab

restore the database
  - save the password hash for the admin user from the user table, just in case the password was different
  - go to the database, import dump, select database file (zipped)
    - make sure the table prefix is the same as the one entered during installation. If not, can change it in phpmyadmin: on the view tables screen, at the bottom there’s a drop-down menu with the replace table prefix option in it
      - in Plesk, can’t choose ‘wp_’ table prefix. Plesk will change this and generate a random one for security reasons and for multi-site reasons. So, make another one up based on the site, like ‘rn_’ for rahil’s notepad.

restore the content files
  - just go to blog-home/wp-content and extract all of the backups there. There should be a folder for themes, plugins, uploads, and a few files such as index and .htaccess
  - start with themes and others, uploads (any time), and then do plugins last


## problems after Wordpress is installed:
a common problem are plugins
  - rename the folder of the particular plugin (to [name]-old? i don’t remember...)

404 on every page other than the home-page:
reset the permalinks
go to Settings, Permalinks, press Save button

critical errors
enable debugging
  - add this line to the wp-config file (**remember to turn off** before exporting!!)
    - define( 'WP_DEBUG', true );
  - https://wordpress.org/support/article/debugging-in-wordpress/
it often gives the exact line of the culprit error, except for callbacks
  - i ended up downgrading PHP from 7.4 to 7.3, but really, i didn’t need to! I just forgot to turn this off!! :(

redirects:
installed the redirection plug-in

re-direct the base-url to ‘/blog’
“create a .htaccess file in root folder, and put this content inside (just change example.com and my_subdir):”

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^(www.)?example.com$
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/my_subdir/
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /my_subdir/$1
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^(www.)?example.com$
RewriteRule ^(/)?$ my_subdir/index.php [L] 
</IfModule>

https://wordpress.org/support/article/giving-wordpress-its-own-directory/
  - this document contains the above method (keep ‘/blog’ sub-directory)
  - this document also explains how to properly change the site url to completely remove the ‘/blog’ in the url (it’s a longer process)
