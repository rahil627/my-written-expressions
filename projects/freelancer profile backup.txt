profile / about
I’m hoping to use this site to get some game-making practice in. Like any other sport or skill, game-programming requires practice. I want to stay in shape. In addition, it’ll allow me some opportunities to try some game engines that I normally wouldn’t choose for my own projects. (and borrow some good ideas to put into my own hand-made 2D game engine :) )
