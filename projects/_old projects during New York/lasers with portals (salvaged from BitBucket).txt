goals:
  - 1. prototype in Unity
  - 2. playtest at hackerspace
  - send gameplay video to Studio Mercato

see design
see old project
  - delete old project?
prototype in Unity
test fast, slow, and instant lasers
keep everything visible so players can strategize

without looking at old design:
  - just go at it, it's straightforward what's needed:
    - reuse player class from Crystal Brawl
  - geometry wars style controls
    - add rotation toward analog stick (or keyboard thingy)
    - test on gamepad
  - add four players
  - laser
    - a list of line renderer or sprites (scaled rectangles)?
      - try line renderer for now, can extend, or use sprites later
    - raycast for collision testing
  - portals
    - just do the main function for now
    - if it touches any part of the image, trigger portal
    - depending on the angle the line hits the portal, it should 
  - could use one class for everything, and change the sprite color programmatically
  - done!
    
  think:
    - what if a laser partially touches a portal?
    - need single pixel line? If any part of the laser touches, it portals
    - if 
  
later:
  - think about controls, shoot with analog stick? Press button then analog? L1, R1, R2 to choose weapon?
  - more physical movement?
