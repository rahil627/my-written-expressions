should try to write some rap/spoken word/poetry

some sort of freewriting:
placed in a decrepit world to make flowers,
but why make 'em when I know it's going to the dump.
the dump, a symbol of the future of mankind,
everything in the industrial world points toward it,
"young professionals" breaking every moral law,
becoming CEOs, never learning

why even try to make flowers when you know the outcome,
it takes a movement to move the structure,
it takes human deaths to begin a movement,
and in the end people will still bitch about people dying or nothing changing

...eh need a topic, this is too broad.

I think I'd be able to write the lyrics after making the music. The music should set off some creativity; It provides an atmosphere, sounds, crecendos/decrecendos, etc.
