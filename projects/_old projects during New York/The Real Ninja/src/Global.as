	//jack o' lantern
	//What the. Who's putting jack o' lanterns on the street? No matter. I'll just have to jump over them to avoid being seen.
	
	//parent
	//Parents! They're not to blame. Best to avoid them. I'll just have to duck under their flashlight.
	
	//ninja
	//Great wannabe ninjas with broadswords. This will be cake. Just slice 'em.
	
	//samurai //TODO: *I'll* attack him
	//What kind of ninja brings friends along? Time to show this samurai professional swordsmanship. Attack him when his guard is down.
	
	//zombie
	//Ahhh, the classic... I guess I'm supposed aim for the neck?
	
	//medieval level
	
	//knight
	//Look at this kid. He wrapped himself in aluminum and claims he's a knight. I'll find another way to further humiliate him. Perhaps those chandeliers will come in handy.
	
	//cavalry
	//Wait...Are those parents underneath that horse? *sigh*. White people.
	
	//boss knight
	//Wow... Now that's just a waste of aluminum foil. I bet their mothers are angry.
	//...
	//WORD TO YOUR MOTHER!!!
	
	//end
	//A cop shows up. "Hey, kid. You there. The kids have been compaining about you. I heard you've been tearing kid's costumes in this neighborhood."
	//p: ...
	//Oh don't want to talk, huh? Let's see who you really are.
	//[in game, the cop approaches the protagonist]
	//The cop forcefully removes the protagonists costume
	//the protagonist cries [stop music]
	//no...no...Nooooooo!!
	//cop: So this is the little runt causing all the trouble? Sure is ugly. Let's find his parents. --see WATCHMEN, Rorshach revealed
	//[player dies]
	//the protagonist is shown, decostumed, crying
	
	//later... [black screen]
	
	//I'm no ninja. I'm no better than any other kid...Not yet, at least. With more training, I WILL, beceme a REAL ninja.
	
	//the background should be black, with random lights in the back representing other trick-or-treaters. There should be houses every now and then too. Generate the background? Add glow effects, try to make it pretty.
