# design notes from yellow notepad
## lasers and portals refound
portals must show direction [in 2d]
xbox style controls, accurate, use xbox controllers to test!
  - right analog to shoot laser
    - hold red button / blue button and press analog to shoot portal
    - press enter button again to deploy
    - (all actions are instant)
or: one analog, lightly move analog to fire direction
or: slow gun rotation for movement
cannot shoot laser if too close?
lasers move slowly
prototype colors: matte black, white; 3d red/blue, light opacity; distorted background
lasers bounce off of walls? And level walls, which play vs(players?) do not
idea: show lasers slowly to trap players into a maze
can break lasers with portals half way through
