## title
Becoming a Film Essayist

## blurb
A photo contains an infinite amount of words. A video, infinite photos. A writing, finite concepts. Film essays, finite *and* infinite concepts.

## risks and challenges
Symptoms include: winter blues, inconsistent practice, a low risk of deportation, loss of appetite, and a chronic love-hate relation with technology.

The main problem is the winter blues. *That’s* probably why I’ve turned to art mediums to talk to!

A real problem that I often forget is if immigration, for whatever reason, doesn’t allow me in again (one year in, so far so good... though I haven’t been tracking Trump...).

A more practical problem is lack of practice with equipment and work-flow:

Assuming my camcorder works, I would still have to make sure I can stabilize it while walking, biking, and motorcycling. That’s at least two DIY rigs. I want the camera *moving* most of the time.

If the camera doesn’t work, I’d probably just buy an old iPhone 3/4 just because I remember it being oh so comfortable and therefore expressive. I used an iPhone4 for most past videos and photo projects (I miss it dearly). Besides, it’s mostly just video and ambient recording, then narration recorded in later. Nothing complicated—In the future I hope to fetch a lapel microphone set-up for 1-2 subject videos.

Though as simple as all this is, I think achieving that natural workflow is *everything*. I want it to be as natural as thinking while peering out of the bus or train window. Slow train window essays would be great...

### project
Or: On Why You Should Fund Me to Become a Film Essayist

This project’s intention is to Kickstart my plunge into film-making, and transition my expressions from mere languages to films *and* language: *film essays*.

Thus we already have a contradiction: Why the heck would you fund an essayist? Well, what good was any essayist: Virginia Woolf, The Frankfurt School?; Or any person that puts together words: MLK, GZA, your favorite local writers, orators, lyricists (hip-hop, folk), friends? For me, it’s the strange way in which we’re able to conceptualize and re-conceptualize our world from other’s words. Surely there’s someone that gets something out of them, similarly, I can only hope the same of mine. All I can provide are my interests, values, likely subjects, motivations: *the content*. Along-side that, I can try to provide my artistic direction for those more into the exploration of art mediums: *the aesthetic*. Based on these two, you can decide.

But before that...

#### why *film* essays?
Because reading *sucks*! Ask the kids, where they learned everything from. Reading is probably the *last* source. At least it was for me.

There was a [moment](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/an-attempt-to-write-everything-i-know) in my past where I attempted to simply write everything. [I did!!!](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/valuable-things-ive-written) And [I hated myself during the process of it](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/no-more-writing), because I felt I had to read *before* I could write (to competently express myself through writing). It felt backwards because it is backwards. It’s consumption instead of creation. And besides, I hate reading!

It was a terrible process of extracting the tools and concepts from writing. The world of published writings is a strange, narrow world of elite educational institutions (even here, in the libraries of Taiwan! :( :( ). *Grosss*. When I started reading, I could only be critical and see the ideologies of the author’s minds, unable to really understand the author’s intended meanings anyway. On the flip-side **I also hated writing because I could neither fit my thoughts nor the world into it.**

So, now, what if those thoughts were encapsulated in film-essays? Would that have made me more able to express myself more closer to my intended meaning (during that time and state of mind) in **the language that we all know** (pardon me blind people...hmmm...)? [I think] Most of the content of a film essay is the film. The linguistic content can be really simple, just used to direct attention toward something in the film.
 
What if I had simply used the informal language that I grew up with—Black American English? That *is* my native language, after all. (I’m not black, but I grew up in VA with friends that speak blacker than my blackest friends. Haha, and I love and miss it mayne.)

Further, what if everyone is able to make film-essays? Isn’t it more engaging (gestalt) to learn from than mere words? Do you feel what you read is ever close to your view of reality, the author’s view of reality, or even the author’s intention? Are you constantly conscious that someone, somewhere, at some time, in some state, actively wrote what you are reading? If not, that could be problem. You might have forgotten what *real* is.

Or maybe writing just sucks. (Most of it is *fake* anyway.) And maybe film-essays are the cure.

### the content
The video content will begin super simple. Just videos shot from public areas: city streets, nature, farms: the environment: the world.

The linguistic content will also begin simple, questioning reality: like, **how did the world come to be**, where did the materials come from (associating material with space), who built everything (the history of an area), how, how did the cultures over-time shape it, how did the place shape culture, who’s in those isolated Asian apartment buildings, what’s all of the work that it takes to create a plate of food, what is a person thinking as they commute to work, are people thinking or is it all actions influenced by capital, where are places where people act freely in the world, *what’s going on*.

The important thing is that the video, the reality, is linked to the linguistic content, to really engage, *move* the viewer. To me it’s non-sense to talk about ethics or just about anything real unless the particular time and place are linked to it.

The content will of course change over my life so I can only provide what some recent feelings have been on: mostly the difference between urban life and areas and rural life and areas, and, living naturally. That’s because I recently moved from a natural place to an urban one and yearn for the natural. So, I’m not gonna lie, there’s going to be a very environmental, critical, maybe anarchic bent to my stuff. That’s the truth though, ain’t it? It all depends on my mood at the time of making. I hope by the time it’s summer I’ll be able to see the beauty, the art in everyday actions of humanity again...

### the aesthetic
This project follows something close to a few film-makers and photographers I’ve felt a connection with in my past: [Vincent Moon](http://www.vincentmoon.com), Brandon Stanton ([Humans of New York](http://www.humansofnewyork.com/), click “Stories”), and [Chris Marker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Marker) ([Sans Soleil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans_Soleil)). I think they will serve as my will ‘o wisps.

Each person is documenting the present world, reality, by recording it. Vincent leaves the sounds to the performing subjects and the images to their surrounding environment. Brandon adds the words of the minds or stories of his subjects *after* the photo. Chris adds his own thoughts in audio simultaneously *with* reality.

I’m simply just interested in being able to express myself with the inclusion of recently recorded reality. Where words and image converge, I’m unsure, and that’s where I’ll really be experimenting, playing with the language (spoken and written via sub-titles), video, pace (timing).

### other films
I think along-side making film-essays, there will still be other films. Though not directly part of this project, they will surely affect my ability to make films-essays.

One set of films will be a continuation of following street people and natural people: small farmers, fishermen, recyclers, environment cleaners, hand-made craftsmen, hand-made cooks, and other lifestyles a hippie may proclaim as ideal. These will be extremely simple, a day in the life of... sort of thing, more for shooting practice (and a personal interest). There’s a possibility these will be turned into film-essays. Why not, haha.

Another set of films might just start with old recorded footage and photos I took during my vagrant life that I never used. That’s the perfect initial editing practice, as I don’t have to shoot anything. (Whoa! This is exciting...!)

Later it would be nice to trace those initial simple questions to or from the sources—factories, farms, natural areas, oral histories, recorded histories mapped with space, infinite possibilities—but those are documentaries on their own. For the moment, I just want to be able to talk[, through film essays].

### cost
Although the amount to kickstart is equivalent to a week and a half of (full-time, min. wage) work in the US ($375 * 1.5 weeks + max KS fees (10%!?!?) + max bank transfer fee), the cost is a bit arbitrary. The kickstarting cost is the about the cost to kickstart myself out of poverty (which enables me to do it; see my bio), place myself in a position to be self-sustainable again (doing hippie labor part-time), and save my laptop. The cost is secondly used as measure of public interest towards the idea. Kickstarting it enables me to begin soon, as opposed to later in life. Any more money informs me how much time and attention should be spent toward the project, compared to the other infinite things that take time from life. Thus: **$643.75 to be able to start making films asap. Anymore to make me feel *real* good about the idea** (and my choices in life, haha).

#### detailed cost
##### project costs:
* $0-25 international bank transfer fee (may be lessened by digital currency transfer)
* $200 un-pawn laptop
* $? insurance of film equipment
    - in my backpack for years, unsure of working condition, currently with a local folk musician friend who should be updating me soon... At worst, I buy an old iPhone.
* $20? usb charger
    - to re-charge the tiny battery on-the-go, maybe even while shooting

##### life costs:
* $40+ initial money to buy busking equipment to support myself (a stupid Apple lightning to usb connector [to connect to my MIDI keyboard], and maybe a second-hand keyboard for practice)
* $100 for an initial space of my own
    - the nomad finally settles!? well, I really just need a secure work-space that’s open at night and provides electricity, but the two communes in this city are on hiatus at the moment
* $100-150 visa-run
* $= time
    - to shoot, make, and repeat until my set-up and work-flow feels as natural as writing
* $? replace my tent pole, stitch backpack, fetch my scooter, start another commune, endless desires...
* $? black tea leaves, and, if money allows, chai spices! :)
* $0 KS overhead cost of having to provide time for continuous updates to backers, and, if KS forces me to, rewards. I’m happy to socialize, but, for the most part, I hope it’s just me living as I normally would, and occasionally uploading a video on Vimeo (or whatever contemporary platform), and updating the backers, getting critiques, and, if there are film-maker backers, advice.

### time (asap)
The time to transfer money, fetch laptop and scooter from Taipei, get apartment (searching now), test equipment (testing now), make sure my busking set-up is good, then I’m free!, and therefore can begin.

I imagine two phases: practice, to master the work-flow, and actual, real expression, when I really feel it.

### past tries with film
I tried film a few times in my life:

Once in New York with a Brooklyn like-mind, as part of a crew. I discovered the whole practical part of getting people together (casting, scheduling, etc.) a waste in every sense and was more satisfied of just taking videos of the streets of ethnic enclaves and public transport areas myself, as I was learning so much by traversing through them, slowly, every-day.

I tried again, while traveling in Malaysia, recording local art events, recording local artisans, and even [a tiny film that simply follows a guy that delivers bread from a cart](https://vimeo.com/55547982). The idea again, being **to try to capture the environment, the experience of travel**, as he slowly walks around the busy city of Kuala Lumpur. And again, **having a slow, contemplative pace**. Even after all these years, the subject is still a favorite mine: street people: vendors, buskers, recyclers, etc.

I tried again, in Taiwan with [Humans of Taiwan](https://www.facebook.com/TaiwanesePeople) (inspired by Humans of New York), basically a photo essay project, constantly **trying to find ways to put my discovery of the world into media,** and subverse the narrow world of media in the process.—I kind of consider the Humans project to be an extroverted version of this project. I’m a *way* better introvert.

Now I’m old. At the time of watching films on Netflix, I figured I’d need a whole lot of experience in life. I don’t think I’ve got that much, but, anyway, there are some things to talk about as a start, and, **I think I’ve finally figured out the perfect way to express myself**, absent of all the past nuisances: the film essay.

### fate
Filiming has been on my mind since that time I devoured every film thanks to the advent of Netflix (DVD by mail), which has possibly been my primary mediated source of education. From neo-realism (“new wave”) movements to Ozu and Koreeda, my late high school, early college years were spent digging wisdom from these films. [My favorite films]((https://letterboxd.com/rahil627/list/rahil627s-favorite-films/)) were those contemplative ones with a rather slow pace, so that I could consume the world slowly, and ponder upon it, like a traveler, but in the suburban house that I grew up in.

### possible origin of inception
Though the idea of actually being able to film (and document) while traveling may have came from Vincent Moon (for me), who basically recorded musicians plainly in their home environment, and continued doing so for anthropologic tribal performances, I think it was Chris Marker who showed that videos of reality, the streets, of past and present, can all be patched together to express an infinite amount of ideas: culture, history, art, philosophy, my mind, others’ minds; All of which is entangled with with reality. All of that, by himself.

### other works that come to mind
Those old BBC documentaries—Ascent of Man, Connections, etc. Though now a bit dated by histiography standards (was it a history of the West?), Connections at least had the notion and *sense* to link the present with historical cultural changes (technology). It comes close to answering the question: why do people behave the way that they presently do?, which is ever-present to any conscious person. Similarly, I often desire to connect present video with thoughts on present human behavior.

王家衛’s (Wong Kar-Wai’s) films, as they tend to have the thoughts and mind of the characters narrated over images, as opposed to dialog, usually in a placid, dreamy way. That mix of image, words, pace, is quite close to my desires. That scene with the Taiwanese butcher from 墮落天使 (Fallen Angels) comes to mind. (Don’t expect Chris’s cinematography though!) The simplicity of Chinese language really works well, making it poetic even, so I’m thinking of using at least two languages: Chinese and informal English.

Žižek’s The Pervert’s Guide to Cinema series of films, as it’s basically just the philosopher providing critical commentary atop and ideas in-between cuts of old films.

### work ethic warning
Though I can be an American workaholic (useful for the practice phase), I hope to live at an Asian farmer pace—slow life, moved by the sunlight, moving in the moonlight. I want to live a simple life while art-ing simple lives. This is a life-long part-time project among several life-long part-time projects.

...Welp, here’s to wishing this were the last time I ever had to write anything again (save these darn Kickstarter proposals...shout outs to Kickstarter though)!
