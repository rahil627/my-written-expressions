heyo Zack,

I’m trying to create a few digital organizations, along with some simple knowledge-bases—wikis. One of them is about experimental games (another is about fighting games). https://github.com/Rahil627/experimental-game-anarchy/wiki/

To begin, I’m trying to just collect some data to create a list of “experimental” games. What experimental means, i’ll figure out later. For now, I just want to gather a bunch of game names along with what they explore in the game medium. Later, I can go back and clean it up (“curate”).

I wonder, do you happen to know any good places on the interwebs that may contain similar lists? The high quality the curation, the better. Here’s what I got so far...: https://github.com/Rahil627/experimental-game-anarchy/wiki/lists .

Also, this isn’t limited to video games, so... there should be many sources for all kind of strange stuff...

Well, I believe that’s that.

Hope all is well in NYC!
