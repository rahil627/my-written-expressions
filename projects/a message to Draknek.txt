heyo Draknek!

Well, first, congrats on the game. :)

Now then...!:

I’ve been out of the art game making world for a decade, and during this quarantined winter in another country, I’ve decided to just sit down and make games again! :)

But, unfortunately, FlashPunk is long gone now (though, surprisingly, Flash isn’t...yet!). So, I was wondering, is there any new place where FlashPunk folk hang?

I checked HaxePunk, but even that seems rather abandoned... Both the project and the forums. There’s a Haxe discord... but it just doesn’t make sense to have a community based around a single technology... I’m guessing many of the older people now have their own little custom engines that they use!

Is there some sort of general indie game dev discord server or forums somewhere?... with the same sort of DIY punk vibe? IndiePunk?

If not, maybe I’ll have to start one up? :/

Anyway, hope all is well. Your game seems like a fantastic, peaceful, sokoban. :)
