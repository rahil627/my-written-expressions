anarchy vs community
dao vs anarchy
project vs programme
  - are these the same?
  - apparently, programme is the original French word
initiative
scene vs movement
...

*Experimental* Gameplay Project
  - explore the medium?
  - like experimental music

Fighting Gameplay(?) Anarchy
  - gameplay sounds a bit... strange
  - fighting game vs fighting gameplay

x/The Dao of Experimental Gameplay
  - not a way of living; **it’s a society, a community**

Scene?
  - meh, sounds too much of a fad

Movement?
  - nahhh

dao vs anarchy
  - way of living (ethics) vs natural, grassroots communities
  - daoist community?
  - **the way of fighting games** vs fighting game anarchy
  - **the way to great fighting games**?
  - grassroots fighting games
    - nah, this isn’t a grassroots community

fighting game anarchy... just sounds like a messy community... it doesn’t seem to have a direction, whereas, the way adds that sense of direction. Anarchy sounds lost. Dao knows the right way, an infinite way.

The Way of Fighting Games
The Way to Great Fighting Games
  - the way to seems too guided, as if *I’m* guiding it
  - **the way of fighting games is fateful**

**the way also fits my public site: wolf of the way**

conclusion:
the way of fighting games
the way of experimental games
the way of nature
the way of Taiwan (national)
the way of Taidong (local area)

the way of fighting games
**the dao of fighting games**
  - the way is generic. spiritual, perhaps, but it doesn’t have the origin that dao has. But maybe that makes it less culturally-specific.

wolf of the way
wolf of the dao

**yeah, i like ‘way’ better.**

put your name on everything! As Zack said.

rathewolf’s The Way of Fighting Games
  - an anarchy that shares a love/pursuit of fighting games

rathewolf’s The Way of Nature
  - okami.wolfoftheway.com, this repeats wolf twice
  - okami.rathewolf.com, this is alright, it just feels like a project
  - japanese.wolfoftheway.coml, this works, but meh
  - guide.wolfoftheway.com, ah, this is better

willowolf
  - ohhh right, this was the site! shit.

rathewillowolf.com?
rathe.willowolf.com?

willowolf:
fga - feisty.willowolf.com
ega - curious.willowolf.com
nga - natural.willowolf.com
ra   - ra.willowolf.com

can try to use cultural references, or natural references... nah, **it’s better to use simple, more general areas so anyone can relate**

desert.willowolf.com, pretty good because of resource scarcity
**forest.willowolf.com**, because forests contain nature’s many curiosities
sea.willowolf.com, sea corals are diverse too... but can wolves swim? :/
**mountain.willowolf.com**, because mountains are nature’s last restort
valley.willowolf.com, a good contender for nga

moon.willowolf.com, this is awesome!
  - sun.willowolf.com
  - comet.willowolf.com
  - sky.willowolf.com, this is also pretty dope!
  - ...

snow.willowolf.com
  - rain.willowolf.com
  - sunny.willowolf.com
  - grass.willowolf.com
  - prairie.willowolf.com
  - sand.willowolf.com, this doesn’t provoke as much images as the area names do

**these are awesome!**, *fantastic*

my own username:
**should be one unique word to make it easily searchable on the web**

ra vs rathewolf vs willowolf vs ra the willowolf
  - they can all be uses, no need to be vs

ra, my nick-name, but it’s not searchable
rathewolf, my web-name, along with rahil627 (can trash rahilpatel.com)
  - could buy rahil627.com instead of rahilpatel.com
willowolf, my public-facing name
ra the willowolf, my full nick-name

copied from github readme of the willowolf repo:
[kind].willowolf, is the name of product ‘n logo  
the way of [type], is the title  
a [type] anarchy, is the sub-title / description

example:  
hongry.willowolf  
the way of fighting games  
a fighting game anarchy  
a digital anarchy centered on fighting games  

willowolf vs wolf of the way

desert.willowolf vs fg.willowolf
  - desert creates a distinct type and image of a willowolf, whereas fg directly tells what the project is about
  -  *  **i really don’t like that OSs use this kind of naming convention. Mac OS’s snow leapord or Ubuntu’s gazelle has nothing to do with the product, except associate an image. Does desert willowolf do more? Or is it just a lame mascot?**
  - fg.willowolf, the willowolf of fighting games, makes sense, similar to fighting games way of the wolf (fg.wayofthewolf). thus, desert willowolf does indeed feel like an extraneous mascot
  - can use domain redirects (or even aliases! ...but shouldn’t)

fg.willowolf.com, redirects: desert, fight, fighting, fightinggames  
eg.willowolf.com, redirects: forest, experiment, experimental, experimentalgames  
ng.willowolf.com, redirects: mountain, nature, natural, naturesguardians, dao

**see StackExchange’s list of sites to see how sub-domains are used**
  - it seems the length of the name doesn’t matter. Things should only be abbreviated if they are normally called by their abbreviated name (diy), otherwise, let it be long (experimentalgames).  

taken from a github readme:
it’s reserved as a home for projects that have grown beyond my control at rathewolf.com, ready to be on it’s own, with it’s own name, with it’s own established identity, with a history.

rathewolf’s fighting game anarchy
or
**fighting game anarchy; a willowolf**

rathewolf and willowolf are the common searchable words
ra has my name
with the keyword first, it would show up together in an alphabetical list

**yes! finally!!! i figured it out!: I’m finally happy with the second one.**
**rathewolf = personal art**
**willowolf = for the people “art” (tool-making)**
