remote work:
methods:
beyond the normative scheduled jobs (fixed hours), technology has enabled people earn (and invest, from the other side) via individual or crowd funding.

Funding services (Patreon, etc.) can be used for people that work on multiple small projects, local projects, etc. This way, you could, potentially work on various diverse projects and gain wealth.

So, instead of asking for certain apps for jobs, can work with carious open-source apps, and try to get funding.

some stable all-remote companies:
most of these were found through remoteok.io
perhaps uses remoteintech.company too

DuckDuckGo
  - a morally good Google
  p/- asked about general application because there were no fitting positions at the time that I checked
Creative Commons
Wikimedia Foundation
Automaticc
  - maker of Wordpress.com (the biggest WP hosting site?) and of many WP plug-ins such as Jetpack
  - owned and run by a co-founder of Wordpress
WPMU
  - incsub.com is the name of the company that owns the product
  - has it’s own set of plug-ins, sort of proprietary, so they can charge a monthly price (to use the plug-ins)
  - it also has a ton of content about using Wordpress
AirTable
  - a simpler database app
CouchSurfing
  - all remote?
x/Komoot, a trail-planning app
  - hires only within EU?
  - non-tech positions require EU languages
PaperPile
  - a simple solution for citing works and gathering academic papers from the internet

job listing sites:
https://remoteok.io
  - **the perfect classifieds for remote work!**
  - https://remoteok.io/remote-jobs/76383-remote-nomad-promote-us-while-travelling-tab
    - Tab, a booking / paying service for hospitality services, looking for a promoter / seller

remoteintech.company
  - https://github.com/remoteintech/remote-jobs
    - the GitHub text is more readable!
  - **a publicly editable list of all-remote companies**

https://www.glassdoor.com/Job/
  - mainly for showing expected salaries, it now has a solid job listings
  - can search by keywords, such as “game qa”, other-wise, the filters are lackluster

https://www.ziprecruiter.com
  - a newer site, pretty, functional
  - https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Jobs/Game-Tester/
  - https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Jobs/Remote-Game-Dev

https://jobs.gamasutra.com/
  - seems like **a very well maintained selection, only one page long**
    - worth subscribing to

itch.io
  - **beautiful site**
  - ...but is there a jobs listing?

https://remoteok.io/remote-game-dev-jobs
  - most contemporary

https://gamedevjobs.io/
  - location-dependent, mostly big companies
  - can try, but doubt it, still seems out-dated to more contemporary sites
  - Unity work-place experience coordinator
    - https://careers.unity.com/position/workplace-experience-coordinator/2114525

https://gamedev.jobs/
  - eh, worse UI, worse listings

reddit
  - game developer classifieds
    - https://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/
      - specific searches in the about page
  - https://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevJobs/
    -  specific searches in the about page
  - there are “communities” based on game engines, then from there, can find specific jobs
    - for example, Haxe has a frequent round-up which includes jobs
    - a list of available jobs
      - https://github.com/skial/haxe.io/labels/jobs
        - seems out-dated
     - https://www.reddit.com/r/godot_classifieds

Haxe round-ups
  m/- http://shirogames.com/jobs/
    - Bordeaux, France. Their biggest hit was a RTS game

stack overflow
  - ...? I dunno. This seems too nerdy. Also, it’s likely limited to programmers, whereas Reddit is more inclusive, open to all

angel list
  - can save searches and get e-mails for them
  - mostly shit Silicon Valley-style start-up stuff

non-tech?
