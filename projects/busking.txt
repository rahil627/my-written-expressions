  - You'll have to Audition for one. Taipei is tough, lot of top notch buskers there. But still, if you're half way talented should be fine. Google Taipei County Cultural Center. From there you should find information about the auditions. [Bureau of Cultural Affairs, Taipei City]

# from a paper note
Ragnarok is Korean! Can learn and play K-RPG music whilst busking Korea!
  - always comes back to games. :)

# from thoughts from east side trip.txt:
## a sticky note
record environment
---
kids
train
traffic
$nature - insects, birds, etc,; beach, stream, waterfall, night market, day market
urban - 7/11, family mart, familiar sounds
people - talking

fun! simple music-making (in public)

vs

folk, talking, singing, rapping, etc. [lyrical]
  - performance art!

## a sticky note
self-record
---
[illustration]
iPhone or GoPro on a tripod, or, on a random object
  - [can also be used to record ambient sounds]
  - [todo: research / buy second-hand online (iPad and GoPro)]
Zoom h4n on the floor [optional, for live feel]

## a sticky note
busking -> cafe (ver 1.)
---
anywhere comfortable

[illustration:]
MIDI controller -> iPad (as DAW) -> (wireless/bluetooth) speaker
  - airplane mode (to save power)

todo: check power consumption

if wireless/bluetooth speaker, place it anywhere
must have good battery duration

compare bluetooth vs wired power consumption
  - [for the iPad]

thought:
add GPS to automobiles + backpack + iPad/iPhone
