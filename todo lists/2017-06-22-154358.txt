A thought while being really high:
1. How stupid it is to waste the mind's attention for bodily experiences, physical movement: preparing food, shower, walking, thinking about doing those things.

2. Values of people coming together, reason (depends on people that go, therefore the values of people), individual  instrumental rationality for an idea.

Thoughts from yesterday:
Humans and environment. How care of environment changes in different areas: care for world (human rights, natural disasters, etc.), care for country (all people, social progress, capital progress), care for city (and people in it), care for home, care for home and assets (farm-land, personal transport), care for nature.

Sense of home in different areas: city neighborhood, suburban neighborhood, rural, nature, etc.

休閒娛樂事業從業人員


我只找簡單的工作吧；體力，送貨，早上做麵包，郵局，夜店門口服務，酒吧，之類。大夜班，沒有車子的時間最好。

我是外國人。沒有工作證。也完全不要（我的護照旅遊的證最和諧。應該沒有人要台灣笨蛋的政府的麻煩吧）。

我會搬家到陽明山（這禮拜我從屏東市會拿行李到台北）。所以我打算每天從山用機車去上班。

我白天做藝術。每一個月需要幾天休。公司沒有人的話，我能替人。

工作簡單，有負責，獨立，請回答吧。

阿，我會英文。我中文也一定有很明顯的口音。工作需要不簡單講，我也會再練習一下。我是很久以前寫的。

我是算背包客，環保，跟大家很會了解，跟大家可以聊天，那種的人。

阿，我會英文，完全不會日文（我的日本朋友回來可以學），也一定有很明顯的口音，也應該需要幾天在練習。哈哈。

算錢少，okay。可能繼續自己學中文。

1. Wash hair
  - brush teeth
  - wash clothes? Nah. Do it every 2-4 days.
2. Wander nature / school
3. Call all job positions I noted
  - at family marts
4. Search and call recent 舉牌 jobs
5. Wander urban
  - look for mom&pop restaurants / businesses. See if any are hiring. Especially vegetarian, or *good* places. 自助餐，機車行 ，腳踏車行，之類
    - around the school area, none of the scooter or bicycle shops were local. Even the shops hiring were corporate. They just have a local appearance. That just leaves vegetarian restaurants.
6. **Use Yelp and Google Maps(?) to find good businesses**

Ask Barrett for place to stay for about a month and a half, or so, until I find a place to camp, or build a place, or buy some land, etc. Or, move near the factory? Or, buy a car.
  - ask Orphic to get a license plate for my scooter. Also buy 阿壯'a car? Maybe only 60,000. Hmm, maybe two motorcycles is best? With a wolf, I can ride long distance for catching gigs. Still, need a home. A tent may not be enough. And it is difficult to pack the bag on the motorcycle.

As always, it is best to work locally, to maintain a state of harmony. Small towns are the greatest.

Todo: inform Orphic of my feelings: that I feel it is best to find jobs locally, face-to-face, as opposed to through digital communication. Tell him that I wandered for a moment around the school campus and found signs of 徵 hiring 工讀生, for a bakery, dessert shop, tea shop, and even an organic shop. In the same way, I think it is best to wander around the place I will live in.

I will ask my second 陽明山 friend if I can stay there, and work at nearby businesses.

I feel that looking for work through websites is just not a good idea, and usually receive bad, money-oriented people.

The local, physical job boards are a great way to find local gigs. First, need to find a good, natural, peaceful neighborhood. Then, can do a **late night / early morning gig.**
--

List jobs done at night, or find keywords:
  - also prefer physical jobs that I can simply clock-in like programming. High wage labour is ideal.
**夜班**
早班
  - maybe too early / sleepy

**送貨**
  - **司機**
送奶
送報
**郵局**
That cat company with 宅
Moving companies?
Other delivery companies in neighborhoods.
Apps? Uber. Taiwan's uber?

麵包店
  - probably easier than 早餐店, but more repetitive. Can learn how to bake bread though. Just bake in the morning. No need to sit and sell.
早餐店
  - seems rough. 24 hour ones at night would be nice.

Google other night shift jobs.

1. 需要短期的家
  - 看陽明山旁邊的宅區的恩友中心，或者是台北social service （北投，士林）
2. 宿舍？JV's hostel? 然後搬到陽明山？為什麼？這裡沒有好人。**看社會的網站。**
  - 是在那裡？ 我的資料看。hmmmm.問billy如果他記不記得那位男生的名字。
3. 後者會台灣南部？ 從台南旁邊開始賺錢。
