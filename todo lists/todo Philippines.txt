21 days without tourist visa

from Floor:
In Philippines I visited El Nido on the Island Palawan. It is hard to get there because you have to fly to Puerto Princessa and from there take a minivan which will take about 8 hours to reach El Nido. It is definitely worth it. You have cheap accommodations, nice beaches and there are a lot of water activities, scuba diving, snorkling, kayaking etc. It is kind of a small village but there are travelers and its just beautiful over there. Don't forget to bring enough money from Princessa, no ATM's in El Nido (I made that mistake :-))

Further, Bohol (Tagbilaran Airport), It's a small Island but very beautifull. A lot of things you can do over there, visit tarsiers, chocolate mountains, native villages and from the main Island can go to Panglao, great for scuba diving and white beaches and so on. I don't know how long you want to go to Philippines but if you also want to see some other things go for Bohol. Stay at Alona beach, Panglao for your padi (couple of backpackers over there, rest is resorts, just ask the cabdriver to drop you at a backpacker) and do a day trip to the main Island of Bohol.

If you want to party hard go to Boracay Island. I haven't been there so no idea how the scuba is over there but everybody says the party is wild.
