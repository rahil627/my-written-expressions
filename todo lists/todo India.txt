feel like making games
  - after prototyping a game, feel like working with an artist, move to where the artist lives, work with them, on the game and possibly a new game, spend time together, design, create, move on. This could be a good balance of work and travel.

for the most part, just sit, think, design, read highly regarded things

  - give everything unnecesary away
    - can give to Bharatbhai's family
