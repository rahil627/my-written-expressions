Whatever you choose, do not choose a job quickly. Take your time. Find the right people, and the right job. It should be something you want to do. Not just for the sake of living in a new place.

book a flight
inform JV's hostel
  - ask for a discounted rate when I get there
search events to meet people I admire
  - talk to people, ask about people's day jobs, gauge the creative industry, create new projects with people, join groups, ask for artist collectives and organizations, join meetings, go with your guts, aim for great people, but don't be extremely narrow minded, talk in a humble yet intelligent manner, be like Jon, a leader, the goal is to create great universal art with a great team. We can incorporate local resources, especially people, in our works.
 
Be careful of time. Don't overwork and don't over socialize.


get a health checkup
  - do a self-checkup
    - check your skin for embedded insects
    - clean your body well

It seems Taiwan has everything except ambition. Perhaps it's the Asian gene.

Is Taiwan the right place? Does it lack talent? Can I be a leader? When I go there, I must search the greatest people of Taiwan's art scene. Game, film, new media, whatever. Run into them. Talk to them. Show my interest. Do stuff together. Intern if you have to.

You have to place yourself where you want to be. You're done exploring. Where do you want to be? I want be in a foreign country so that I maintain creativity. I want to be in a city so that I have friends to talk to. I want to make games, film, new media, and fine arts. What better place is there than New York? Can I begin something in Taiwan? I think so. It's what I want. It should take no time finding the right people if they exist. Research online, talk to people, and figure it out from there.

1. Find great people
2. Pick up projects I am interested in
3. Make money to open a cafe, hostel, or other local business
4. Help local businesses, volunteer
5. Work at a social place part-time
6. Get a girlfriend
7. Don't stop

The first goal in Taiwan is to meet great people. Like Babycastles. Through them I will find great opportunities. Technical ones, or one that requires creativity and technical prowess. I can do social things on the side, like part-time barista, scooter taxi, or volunteer.

When I go to Taiwan. I need to try really hard to sustain a balanced life to achieve the things I want to. I need to be social and outgoing enough (travel mode) to join projects, yet I need to ignore people and work on high level work (work mode). Work only on the things you want to. Do not miss great opportunities.

Create a public arcade.

Talk to people. Find a creative team of diverse people. Join projects*. Join companies. Work together. Make stuff. Don't stop. Enjoy. Be open. Tell people who I am. Listen to them. Create projects. Like Jon, I should be able to gather a team, set a date for a projects, and finish it. Share dreams. Make dreams a reality. Stay outside. Stay in high circles, yet hang around local places. Try to incorporate local people in my work. Help local people out. Film. Game. Music. Fine art. Volunteer. Anything. Well, a combination of professional work, art work, and volunteer.

take a job in the front-end of a cafe that attracts high quality people, artists
  - barista / cashier / manager
  - it would force me to speak mandarin
  - I learn how to make coffees and teas
  - I meet people, making connections for future work and community
  - hopefully on less busy days I can use my computer to make stuff
  - take it as a part-time job in addition to other jobs
  - or is this too humble? Shouldn't I be aiming for grand creations?

BE OPEN. TALK TO PEOPLE. TAKE ON HIGH LEVEL JOBS.
