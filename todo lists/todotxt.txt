# ideals:
  - have two homes:  a natural one and one in the city
    - the city home exists merely as a place to crash while getting money
      - therefore, there isn’t much need to look for an ideal city apartment, unless it is used as a public place
    - the city home can be replaced by a van
    - **the natural home could be in the mountains where it is less humid and less mosquitos**
      - anywhere there is nature (for natural farming), streams (for swimming, bathing, fishing, drinking)
      - the natural home should be either near the city or in the best weather
# important:
notebooks:
  - ask JV’s to mail notebook to Taidong
$?
  - deadline: $69 by 7/10, $40 by 12-14/10
    - need $70, asked for $110 (rounded up to nearest $50)
  - ask Wells Fargo for loan increase
    - tonight, at family mart, or, outside library
  - hope Jon Paypals me
  - buy flight? $42+
# current goals:
  - 0. temp work
  - 1. busk $
    - speaker deadline: 2/10
    - need 800ntd to buy cable
    - need 200ntd to buy hub
    - need $7 to buy synthesia pro (210ntd+)
    -> NSX <3
  - 2. sell food?
    - or continue busking in nearby richer countries
# desires / feels
network/organize to obtain capital;
thought of hippie financing
daydreams of performance at NSX
record local ambience, travel to nice ambience and record there, make a track (Nujabes beat or instrumental music), like Hanabi: kids, play, aboriginals, nature, traditional public areas (traditional markets)
to to buy:
tent pole?
  - or just another, cheaper, simple, stake-less tent
    - check how to pitch my tent without stakes
  - should look for places to pitch my tent! The tent makes a good home, a place to crash without worry.
# later ideas:
  - make a todo app
  - make a writing app
    - buy and try Voice Dream writer
    - ask writebox creator what happened, or if he wants to continue
      - must use twitter to contact :\
  - make a brainstorm app (to mimic blank paper)
    - support connecting lines to words
      - then using the line-word (or concept, could be image) mapping can display content in different ways
  - and other text-based styling ideas
    - general notes (pending, check, strike-through, etc.)
  - multi-media education website?
    - makes linking parts of media easy (time frame of film, part of game, pages of book, etc.)
  - synthesia-style notation writing tool (and playback), having infinite resolution in time and pitch
# main todo

  - lost Voice Dream highlights?

Fuck, I need to remember to chill every morning, write, listen to music, think, before doing anything. The need for money made me wake up into stupid routine recently. Well, that and because I must eat at the buffet restaurant twice a day.

⁠⁠Call home
Go outside, stay outside at all times. Keep moving. Create all of the time (talk to others or self, write). Do passive things while creating. Be with other people all of the time. Use phone to read. Use phone to blog ideas directly? Reduce belongings in small bag. Need a day life. Never ignore the world, always stay in tune with it, you need the exercise and sunlight. :).
去旅行

寫文章
隨時厚實晚上：練習：語法的書，練習的書，卡
