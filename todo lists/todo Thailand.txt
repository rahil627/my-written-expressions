EVERYTHING YOU DO SHOULD BE BASED AROUND WORK. NO SMALL TRIPS. WORK and FAST LARGE TRIPS (UNESCO HERITAGE SITES).

FILM, SCUBA CERTIFICATION, MYANMAR.

Go to Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam


Film contemporary and traditional musicians. Film interesting subjects. Able to find film work? Make sure the film is easy to edit.

Go to beach for a few days. I need some sun and swimming! Get the fuck out of cities and towns.

Spend one day at the beach, snorkel.

x/1.
conclusion: There aren't many great places to snorkel off-shore. Most require boat trips which costs from $10 (home boat(?)) to $30 (tour). It would be a better investment to get scuba open water and advanced open water licenses. Also, Koh Tao, the most popular place to get certified, is one of the best places to snorkel. Also, getting a certification includes dives and acommodation!

Find a cheap place to snorkel off-shore. Learn to swim whilst snorkeling. Can learn to dive afterwards (if wanted).

2.

Where is the best place to dive, and at what time?

Koh Lanta's Dive and Relax teaches one on one, but costs twice as much.

Figure out the best time to go. Is it okay to go during December? Do I have to wait until January? What about tourist traffic?
  p/- Facebook that one guy I trekked to Penang Hill with
  p/- ask a scuba diving agency in Koh Tao
    - Scuba Junction
    - Koh Tao Easy Divers
      - 6 dives, two day trial, private pier (1 of 3 on Koh Tao), training done at sea
    - Crystal Dive Resort


which agency and certification?
  - Koh Tao only had PADI agencies
    - although not as good as non-profit agencies, just do some research to find the best on the island
  - open water allows 20m, and advanced open water allows 30m
  - technical allows deeper
  - master scuba diver costs $1000, not sure what the point of it is


Koh Tao, learn to swim, get scuba diving license (open water and advanced open water), 380 euros, includes accommodation
  - double check by doing some Google research
    - is 380 euros cheap? $500. Should be around $200-300 for open water and $200-300 for advanced.
    - is Koh Tao one the best places to dive? Yep.
    - $20-30 "fun dives", $100 one week unlimited
    - $10/night at fan hostels
      - can snorkel in shark bay

offshore snorkeling?

Forget it. Although it would be nice to snorkel around for a few days, there isn't anything to film. Also, I feel that all of the islands are too touristy. I would rather snorkel at some random beach in an undeveloped area.

I think I'd prefer snorkeling over diving because it doesn't require a limited tour. I can just go to any beach and begin snorkeling. Exploring.

Very difficult to find an island with budget accommodation on it and good offshore snorkeling. The undeveloped islands don't have any buildings on it, and require a day trip via longtail boat tour . The developed islands have too many boats going in and out, making snorkeling undesirable.

need to check weather for east coast monsoon, might cause murky waters

Koh Lipe - pretty good, 500-600 baht for snorkeling, surrounded by many uninhabited islands
Surin - great, no accommodation and requires tour?
Laoliang - great, no accommodation and requires tour?
Ko Adang
Ko Tao - the best, east coast
Ko Lanta - no snorkeling off beach?
  - Ko Rok* - top for snorkeling
  - Ko Kraden / Ko Ngai / Ko Muk- 3 island trip
  - Ko Haa
  - Ko Ngai
Similans
  - no accommodation? Must take trip from elsewhere?

Not:
Krabi/Ao Nong - tourist
Phuket - tourist
Phi Phi - tourist
