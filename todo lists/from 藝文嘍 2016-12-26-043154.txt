**The festiveness and energetic weather of the anime festival normalizes me.** I can work, I can write, I can do anything, here. I fucking love cities. Though a useless anime festival, full of inhuman things, it's still people, diverse, more diverse than most single places.

The place, helmet, mask, wind-blocking mountains: they all block the feeling of the world.

To wake up and walk out is all that is needed.

It's the plaza. It's the public.

It's a love for the public.

It's a love for the people.

Fuck places, I need the public. Go out, and only go into places for work. Stay out. All day.

Need windy windows, open to nature's energy: never stale or sterile.

I can feel life.

滿滿的活
