research Google Glass with Allen
you have to keep walking and talking, experience life, stay outside, then work, live on streets, tire yourself with social interaction

to blog:
“ignore all, and focus”
“create own path”
“keep close contacts”
“live alone, create alone”
stick to NY / high-art / education / film studies
“you have to keep creating and consuming”
“get out of your mind and start doing shit!”

social —> fun —> interaction:
the reason films affected me is because it was the only human interaction I had
consume locally

need to be part of a group:
force yourself to be in a social situation everyday
  - need social job, tons of projects
media gigs, designer, director
leads people, start projects, events, jams —> join Becoming?
talk to studios, NGOs, call people
need social like to think quickly and artfully
to daily manifesto:
don’t just consume, still meet people, interact with people (—> NYU), need artist base, BIG IDEAS

from beyond the left margin:
document less!,
do more!

I need a bustling city to drive me

shoot short films

see grand art,
struggle,
stay outside

next move:
Chinese game
teach
local art /
community /
design

# a torn piece of a sheet of paper
**tools for / to enable human action
more decision, more powerful the community
a community is the total of the decisions made within it**


# a yellow post-it sheet
**much time / effort wasted on social custom, not just activities, but also expectation. The better the society, the more minimalistic it is. The best society lives like savages, but have the highest useful technology. Live in a tent, cook rice and veggies, work on tech and art.**
