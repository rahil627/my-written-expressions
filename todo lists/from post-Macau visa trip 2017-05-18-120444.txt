Missed a thought from earlier today. Is today Mom's birthday?

There's a contradiction. Our minds can handle so much information, desiring to organize it all during our daily lives, yet, an environmental life can be quite simple, boring, undesirable.

Farms are boring because they are artificially chosen plants on a plot of land. Nature is complex, but in my life I've seen so few go this route. Perhaps only 蘭嶼 people.

I too desire to live in the complexity of nature, whilst handling the information of cities: contemporary humans.

Just me on sitting on a fallen tree, using my computer to automate the world, whilst designing my own home out of the surrounding nature.

六點。到了學校已經很累。小包太重。需要一個地方丟東西。將來別拿這麼多東西吧。

只有一個小時多欣賞風景。太少。我工作了太多，想太多；就是通常的。

我覺得我需要每天去出看真實。跟以前住在台北一樣。出去。經驗。每天。晚上做工作。可能是因為我沒有家庭？沒有家。還是，我只是工作了太多。需要一天的休息。對，應該是吧。

今天應該會看過每一個工作吧。跳方便店用手機找工作。明天早起來，出去。

1.
What characteristics do I have that can be categorized within the female norm?

2.
What makes me seem more feminine is that I don't think about getting money.

For much of my life, I don't think about getting money. I may help my family with chores, family business, problem-solving. I generally try to help the people around me. Sometimes I have a desire or end to achieve, but it's intention is never to gain money. Perhaps influence the behavior of people to be more natural, or educate people, or just stop people to think, or to spend more time socializing and being with friends, or pushing people to interact with 'others', etc.

I simply lived with people, had experiences together, but I avoided any sort of behavior of which who's goal is to gain capital. The only times I worked for capital were my first two jobs, the first of which prevented fraud and used a skill I was interested in; the second was out of anxiety. Since then, I merely helped the people around me with their work; I just lived, doing whatever the culture does of the place and time I am in.

This behavior, of simply living within a culture, is a characteristic of the feminine. Caring (child-rearing, peer care, cooking, household management, "family care"), talking (educating by language), being together (educating by model), are not accounted for in capital, yet, are the most important, and happens to be things that I cherish too.

I am feminine because I care, don't mind talking, often enjoy being together, and don't calculate my time. I don't calculate the time that I spend caring, talking, and doing things together. Those things are experiences. Experiences which can be an education, result in some wisdom or skills, and make-up a person. Instead of working within some sort of institution or business that is limited by place due to the idea of property, limited by the time of people are able to physically get there, getting in a place and paying the manager; the feminine, avoids it all, by simply being near the people.

I spend time with people (directly), not businesses nor institutions. The masculine spends time with businesses and institutions, not people. Using this definition, Japanese culture is nearly entirely masculine, as even prostitution is the norm (thus a business, as opposed to simply having sex with a partner, without any sort of capital transaction), and everything within the culture is calculated.

"Traditional" households don't calculate such things. Food and housing are free, so is being a part of the household (family, community). **But when everything outside the household *is* calculated, why shouldn't the things done inside the household not be calculated? (Both [physical] businesses and houses are usually on property.) This is why the masculine have power: They ask for money, and calculate their "work" (wage labour). The feminine doesn't (ask for money).**

Thus, the masculine have power because their work falls within capitalism, where the feminine's work is outside of it.

**Thus, a way for the feminine to get power to simply ask for money for everything that they provide / do -- care. Care must be valued within capitalism.**

It is strange that Japanese culture pays for "comfort women", spas, massages, cafes, time with the feminine being together in some sort of room. It is stranger that the West doesn't pay to spend time with feminine.

Gender equality doesn't mean equality in wage labour. Gender equality means equally valuing the work (with capital) outside of capitalism. People with masculine work, are simply the masculine, no matter their gender. (Todo: make up new words for masculine, feminine. Capitalistic-behavior, Non-Capitalistic behavior)

If one were to calculate all of the work that non-capitalists do, and give them their money, it would surely amount to a sum greater than the capitalists.

When a non-capitalist doesn't have money (which is likely, as s/he doesn't do things simply for capital) s/he must eventually do something in order to survive, either by being in a relationship in which one person gives the non-capitalist money, or, by finally becoming a capitalist. Here is the point where one asks for money for every action done for another, or desired by another. Here is where "tradition" is broken. The "traditional household" is destroyed. Everything is calculated. That is the only way non-capitalists can acquire equality [within capitalism].

Well, that, and perhaps self-sustainable living.
