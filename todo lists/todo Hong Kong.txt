x/get a visa to China to get a glimpse of a town
  - meh, I've got too much crap with me to travel. I'd rather find a place to stay and travel on weekends by just waking up and going. Or planning trips. Also, the interesting Chinese towns are probably far from Hong Kong.

Wikitravel
  - Ride the tram between Kennedy Town and Shau Kei Wan. The journey takes round 80 minutes and costs $2.30. The Hongkong Tramways run between the West and East of Hong Kong Island. Starting from the old district Kennedy Town, you can see the residental areas, followed by the Chinese herbal medicine and dried seafood wholesalers in Sai Ying Pun - Sheung Wan. Then the tram goes in the famous Central district with high rise commercial buildings and banks. Wan Chai and Causeway Bay are the districts popular with shoppers and are always crowded with people at all times. Travelling further east are North Point and Shau Kei Wan areas, which are of completely different styles from that in Central and Causeway Bay.

- Hong Kong island, Central, Soho, Mid-Levels - take escalator, The Peak - peak tram, wan chai and causeway bay neighborhoods, if time
  - Wan Chai - kind of seedy
  - Causeway - a big shopping mall
  - mid-town
- Kowloon
  - Tsim Tsa Tsui
    - the center of Kowloon
  - Mong Kok
    - a bit less expessive
- The New Territories
  - newer parts?
- Perhaps the outer stops of the metro are best
- shek-o - bohemian beach town
- lama island - bohemien
  - son ku wan - another small island
- Fo Tan

areas:
  - SOHO

hipster areas:
  - Sheung Wan
    - Visage One
Start your ramble where Central’s SoHo district ends and Sheung Wan begins, at the stairs from Hollywood Road (main street) to Mee Lun Street. Tai Ping Shan Street. Friday night. Gough Street and On Hing Terrace.
    - The Cat Street Gallery
    - Sin Sin and ParaSITE galleries
    - The Space
    - food on Gough street
  - Tai Ping Shan Street?


"Don’t get me wrong. Sheung Wan is just round the corner from me and lovely to wander around during the day or occasionally stop for a bite or a quick drink in the evening. It’s pretty relaxed and has some decent chow houses, but is not an area I’d travel to for a hip night out. 208 and Oolah are overpriced ponce-holes and Yardbird doesn’t serve close to as good yakitori as you’d find in even the dirtiest Shinjuku hole-in-the-wall. I have yet to visit Squarestreet and Visage One but given that they’re shut more nights of the month than open, they probably don’t fit the bill for regular hipster haunts.

In the end I suppose it’s all relative. If we are forced to split this peculiar former colony up into districts, Sheung Wan is probably hipper than the rest of the island, just as Hong Kong is probably hipper than Macau or Singapore. But it can’t out cool most of the rest of SE Asia and there are hipper bars in provincial towns in Japan than there are here."

Raymond's todo list:
temple street market
take star ferry, eat seafood
walk up the peak on Hong Kong island
temple of ten thousand buddhas

Must have a great hostel or couchsurf.

couch surfing intro and trip:
I'm Rahil. I've just finished a lengthy trip through south and southeast Asia. I'm planning to live and work in East Asia. My main goal is to find like-minded people to make cool stuff with, likely joining or creating a design company. But I'm open for any work that interests me. I plan to do this in an social and cheap way: couchsurfing, work exchange, travel, temporary work. Taking in everything.


The trip:
I plan to meet people, seek out the contemporary art scene (new media, game, film, installation), and uh, explore! Duh. It would be cool to learn some Cantonese basics too. I plan to stay for a week more and then go to South Korea.
