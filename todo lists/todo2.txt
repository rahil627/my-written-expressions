from an old note:
I think it’s a profile post:
Ideally it would start with local projects in film, game, and new media. I'm open to anything as long as it's social, local, and meaningful. All of this while making universal films about life and futuristic doo-hickeys. Some work days need to be dedicated to social work. I'll start a photography series inspired by Humans of New York and a video series inspired by Vincent Moon so that I never forget to keep meeting people, and never forget about people. Yeah! More life, less computering.



overall goals:
  - make $124,000 in a high wage country
    - $36,000 graduate
    - $24,000 debt
    - $24,000 undergraduate tuition
    - $24,000 undergraduate expenses
    - $5,000 car
    - $10,000 other (can pay later)
    - teaching and programming only pays $24,000 / year (in Taiwan), programming in America pays $60,000+, teaching in New York also pays $60,000+, programming in New York pays $75,000+
      - hire an Indian to do the programming work for me?
    - work as a bartender, barista, librarian, someone who is outside in the public
  - write all learned philosophy
    - keep a page with links to all questions still unknown or needs further research / experiment
  - travel with a limited amount of money in South America
    - learn Spanish
  - live in Paris with a limited amount of money
    - determine if you like Paris / France
    - learn French
      - apply for French scholarship
    - focus on fine art (inspired by the city)
  - go back to Taiwan
    - apply for Mandarin scholarship
    - learn Mandarin, make own games? Make Tsai-Ming Liang films. Live extremely cheaply and read books.
    - buy a franchise tea shop or open a new shop or hostel
    - buy apartment in Taiwan
    - get dual citizenship
    - use as base for Asia
      - create / help / work at NGOs across Asia
      - learn Chinese and Hindi
   - try a nordic country. Iceland?
     - Too cold! No street culture. Just internet. Seems like a suburb. Expensive. Taiwan is much better. Icelandic girls are not pretty.
   - high wage country?
     - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_countries_by_average_wage


service work + language classes + social life + social event organization
vs
buying a business
vs
NGO, management

  - arts
  - http://www.fvckthemedia.com/issue23/making-safer-spaces

3. ?

film:
So here's my current plan with film, video and photography:
1. I'm starting a photography series: https://www.facebook.com/TaiwanesePeople .
2. And then a video series somewhat similar to Vincent Moon, who basically shoots performances in local areas (in Chinatown, on a bus, walking on the street, wherever): https://vimeo.com/72990063 . I want to document whatever local musicians and performances there are all over Taiwan, and perhaps nearby countries like the Philippines, from indie musicians to indigenous people doing weird things.
3. And then some uh, you know, real things: narrative, innovative short films and films. Hopefully I figured out how cameras and project management works by this time.

Spend time to write and read. Go over travels, personal history and observations. Create a space for yourself. Your values. Choices. Post physical paper. Bike. Go out. Try Norfolk. If not, use music, radio, connections, films.

Walk, think, write. Design too. Design new media, games, films.
