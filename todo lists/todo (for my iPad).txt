  - oscars speech, somehow got there as a film maker, lol, dreams, speech about slow life:
    - ...urge to live slow, move to. country that smokes weed, see the films again and watch what the grandmother does, chill, cook at home, refuse to work full-time, spend less, spend more time with the people around you, the animals and plants too, try growing a leafy vegetable or continuously leaving one, when you wake up: be concsious why you are even brushing your teeth with toothpaste—instead of the usual going to work, live slow, drive slow homie, pump your breaks and drive slow homie.
    - because when that car crashes, America didn’t teach you why you drive a car, that expensive killing machine, why you think you need it, why you think you need to work, why you think need to get there in time, why you’re moving so much
    - i don’t think it’s a coincidence that the rappers have transitioned from unconscious gangsters to conscious people, or that these two black hippies got here by chance, they’ve got something in their works that resonates the current conditions, and that means we’re on the brink of something, all that American work ethic isn’t working, work work work plays inside cars as Americans go to work, rappers sound schizophrenic of all the non-sense going on in America, no one can make sene of it, neither rappers nor academicians, but it’s the tracks about home that hit home, that low-key one about their mothers and big brothers, that I feel reveal the right way, the right way of living
    - 2nd part is to continue the speech that Kendrick was cut off from (not having time)
    - 3rd part is to have Pharrell make a grindin’ best on a student desk, then I start a simple, non-rhyming freestyle, then, let Kendrick go, then Pharrell go (in which he starts singing), making everyone joyous and chill.
