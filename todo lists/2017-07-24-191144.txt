5/8/17
Just dreamt of sending a natural hand-made care package to my family: toothbrush, coconut oil, local plant mixtures, etc. The care package included a paper of the contained items, a letter, and inviting them to come to Taiwan.

Missed out on my thinking, day-dreaming, writing time. Paul Valery spent 3 hours of everyday writing. His notebooks (Cahiers) became his best regarded work. That's amazing. Reading about that, I felt that perhaps just spending time reading, talking to others through such informal writings, may be the best way to spend one's leisure time. It's perhaps the quickest way to allow the mind to roam and wander. Well, maybe not. I think just experiencing life in a comfortable way is, such as riding a bicycle calmly, or riding a non-air-conditioned train.

Dreamt of creating a map people and organizations on the east coast. Noting, that although locals and government organizations have infinite information, these people are more likely willing, able, and desire to communicate it well. Thus: the East and Central Taiwan Guides map.

Some thoughts from sleeping poorly on the wooden bench near the beach:
There's a lot of factors in comfort. Perhaps beer is the easiest way to fend it all off. But while sleeping, the wind was too much and my small towel didn't cover my entire body, being a bit too cold, and surely too windy. Sleep needs stale air, like a hot summer afternoon. Further, the bench was way too hard, so a sleeping pad, or grass or sand is needed. Without a sleeping pad, a pillow is enough. And in the end mosquitos still bite your face, so one must avoid green places, especially parks with varies nature. Beaches might have less mosquitos because it's so windy. A camp-fire makes it bug-proof. And still yet, there is rain. So, the best solution, is still the tent [or hammock and mosquito net]. An isolated tent, away from people, police, that can be set and not worried about for days. A place where people don't go and harass you. A beach is simplest. Mountain-side would be nice, but perhaps more difficult with more mosquitos and more difficult to get to? Anywhere in nature, not artificial areas. Make a home, like we did at Ocean Home. That's how one begins organizing their life, in one's own way, without politics.

Better than all of that, is an apartment, near the markets. The only problem with it is nature is further away. But, if one can wake up, go to nature, then, it's there. Just not near the home, making things like land-farming, using natural resources, composting, difficult or impossible.

Daydreams:
Living at the town beneath 花蓮, beginning food vending business with naan, which takes much time because of the commute to the night markets. Used some sort of steamer to keep naan warm. Had different flavors: onion, garlic and onion, etc. Had different chutneys: green chile, mango, sweet mango pickled (athunu), red onion sauce (from nawab).
|
The business makes a few thousand NT, which is good enough, but very solitary, and not really fun, not as fun as a social job like teaching, being at an orphanage, being at any sort of community.
|
Better to do the business near the night market, renting a home nearby, or asking / paying a friend for a room for a short period of time. In 台北 can alternate markets and locations, perhaps selling two batches per day.
|
After a month's work, can get back in good shape, test out electric vehicles, look for houses near the mountain, or for a van or convertible truck that can carry several motorcycles. Can even use the van to sell things, making life much much easier, especially for markets far from home.

**Animal tribe certification for environmentally aware (Natural) businesses.** Perhaps different levels: 喜歡環保的人，很會環保，超級會環保。Begin with fast food shops, then move on to other kinds of businesses (inspect vegetarian restaurants for meat, free-range farms for cages, find environmentally-aware businesses [natural paint, electric vehicles, second-hand, shops, etc.]). The certification item must be compostable, natural, and different for different levels, with a logo (including written name of tribe and name of inspector).

Mappings of all Taiwan day markets (including locations where groups of independent farmers sell foods), grain shops (rice, noodle, bread, etc.), Taiwan-grown tea and coffee.

Natural Tech, by Animal Tribe.


More thoughts, after the day:
Can travel through America, working random jobs, living in a car. That sounds much better than paying rent in New York. Just have to catch enough gigs to pay for gas; Unfortunately it's not environmentally-friendly. Can one of those old Varica's be found in America?

Read the news today. An Economist magazine at 台東's cultural library. All of the news is terrible: China and Russia still communist-idea-driven, China always claiming more land, India building more transportation, Venezuela trying to survive anarchically with a bus driver as their new leader replacing Bolivar, stupid leaders doing stupid things.

Sent message to Chris:
Also: I read the news today. Oh boy. A physical Economist magazine in 台東 library. It feels as if it came from The Cold War: Russia and China leaders still have silly political ideals, Venezuela struggles with anarchism, India builds more transportation (destroying environment at a pace near China), China takes more territory, Philippines...??

The dryest thing I've ever read. Perhaps Brits wrote it.

這兩天隨便的想很多。一直白日夢。實際裡我沒做事，但想一想我覺得好棒。我的心裡空了。

。。。

在台灣旅遊太容易。警察給我泡麵，熱水機，水果，茶。外面有好的地方睡。只有文字的問題。要不然沒有問題，可以住的免費。

還在白日夢能盛行。吸引太大。我應該看她們的臉書。 

昨天還是今天夢到了能盛行人來我爸媽的家一起住。我們住的很自然，很隨便的自然。

今天夢到在能盛行我聽八寶表演，他唱著我把她的姊姊的臂很緊，哭。

這幾天夢到幾個志向：想要山旁邊的家--自然的資料，自己賺錢，做不同的工作。想要組織行動。想要改變我住的地方旁邊的集鎮。後來希望改變我集鎮旁邊的集鎮。這小的集鎮我應該完全知道。慢慢改變人的習慣。

如果我有家（車子也算），有錢，有小的城市，我應該會開心。家，錢，給我自由；我喜歡的公共人給我社會。那應該夠了。

**只怕跟很笨的人。沒辦法改變的人。那人讓我被動，然後沒有動機。**

**都市給我動機，因為人會改變；也會說話。**

**所以想要都市因為有會改變的人類，但也想要自然因為我想要自然的經驗--我不要忘記自然。**

**但是大部分的會改變的人住在都市裡，不對嗎？可能不對。最聰明的人自己住，自力更生。不需要其他人的依靠**


29/7/17 at 枋寮 警察局
來這裡的時候我沒聽了媒體：沒聽音樂，沒聽聽書。騎到枋寮有一點恐怖：在185路晚上有恐怖的風景--有山，樹，自然的輪廓的影。跟在樂園晚上像。只有幾個車子，真不多。

自己的時間有趣。沒集中東西，媒體。自然想。跟監獄像。

我一直想離開社會是不好的計畫。我應該別離開，再一次。我因該跟台南的社會區，或者是跟Billy一起做事。

我

但，我總是夢住在台灣東部：自然的地方，山旁邊，跟那些日本電影一樣。

Day-dream of sexuality presentation at the Factory:
我剛剛夢到了：
我在屏東，可能全台灣，覺得太熱，動不到，**被動**的。我有著情緒的時候，覺得每一個性別可以。

為什麼我不對billy，其他的男生美麗？為什麼能盛行的女生都可以？應該是我的腦子裡的教育。

為什麼我對八寶比其他女生美麗呢？她們的心理我一樣不知道。可能因為他有男的感覺？因為我覺得他是最自然的。這裡的人已經有很自然的感覺。可能我覺得八寶更自然。所以，有男性別的感覺（女生，tomboy）是自然嗎？哪女性別是什麼？不自然？可能我覺得男性裡有自然，whereas女性平常不自然。 (todo: continue thinking)

颱風過去了。不錯。我睡覺了到十點半，吃了飯後再一次睡個覺到五點。差不多十點晚上下雨沒了。不覺得緊張。我在隨便睡了。還在覺得安靜。只是下雨，風。實際上覺得有一點舒服。我在小的城市，但是我覺得跟野營一樣舒服：到處我覺得舒服。有熱水，有茶，有飯，有地方可以躺一下。只需要這幾個東西。
