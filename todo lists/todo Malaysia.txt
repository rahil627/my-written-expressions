conclusion, find artists in Malaysia. Film them. If I have time, go to Thailand. Wonder around a small town for one day, then shoot the next, keeping film in mind while traveling. Thinking of film ideas. Are there hostels in small towns? Take scooter to small towns for cultural shooting? Couchsurf?


"I was told all rental bikes are only registered for their local area. Perhaps you should do as Guichard suggests; a combo of renting bikes locally, explore the area and then move on to the next area by bus etc…."

"As far as I know its not possible in any of those places. Motor bike rental is not at all common in Malaysia, unlike Thailand."
