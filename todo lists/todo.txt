Design for sustenance.*

what to do?:
1. read, travel, consume, work (trandiscipline), interact — school (teach or research), NGO, streets,
2. design
3. make - write, material oriented

politics > altruism > fine art > design

altruism - NGO, enabling, teaching under-educated
fine art - writing, philosophy
design - urban

Start an artist village around Taipei, or just help FABLAB.

Go home. apply to art residencies and universities outside of the US. Self-learn languages, workshop materials — metal, wood, etc., use top liberal arts curriculum, use top art and design curriculums, make and document stuff, work at a nearby library or cafe or school. Get a teaching degree. Get a cheap motorcycle.

To thoughts:
not "knowledge is power", but perhaps, lack of knowledge can lead to fear.

I'm changing. Values changing. Becoming more rational? Or less? I'm more robotic, not thinking about every decision, or trying to grasp knowledge from everything outside.

Perhaps what lead me in life was a pursuit of knowledge. It was knowledge that made me want to watch films, want to travel, want to bike. One can gain so much knowledge from just sight.

At the age of 5 I took the training wheels off of my bike myself with a wrench, explored neighboring neighborhoods, coming back at nightfall. There's a thrill to the gain of knowledge.

...
[either from around Hong Kong or in Queens, New York]
Perhaps a studio based curriculum is best after all. I just want to make things and have some guidance along the way.

Really etched out the tabla game idea at a Sikh temple. It would arouse kids to want to learn to play tabla. It would allow foreigners to experience Sikh culture. It would be an amazing experience, just as many Babycastles shows were, but with more travel, like Ida. Also thought about microcontrollers for other instruments.

- emergency: game route is not working
-- failing to find motivation to work on the computer alone
-- need people to work with
-- need faster social feedback
-- need deadlines
-- making games alone is impossible
-- need a social life, then at a public place (outside, park, hostel, hackerspace, fablab, cafe, apartment) make games
-- need more external stimuli
--- need to travel more, spend more time outside. Wake up early.

weekdays:
10am-1pm Mandarin class (book, worksheets)
1-1:30 lunch with classmates? (practice new material?)
1:30-2:00 study? (reinforce: 15min memrise [two books and radicals], 15min audio CD at night, do homework without writing anything [except questions for teacher])
rest of day: try to practice new grammar [good teachers reinforce with homework, if can't in conversation use writing book])
1:30+ life (social? - Humans of Taipei / film / travel / explore / play / NGO?)
? teach class
? MAIN WORK - game route: currently Crystal Brawl and Lasers and Portals, affects future income, but don't rat race it! Follow your feelings.
? consumption:
? OTHER WORK
current: 
1. Make a self-assessment
2. Create more thought experiments about games and interaction.
3. continue reading on philosophy, anthropology, psychology, sociology, evolution, wikipedia articles of great fiction authors, buy the big ideas simply explained book series, listen to audio books of authors that write really well. Listen while programming and writing. Improve writing by reading (or listening). 
stay open and keep consuming Chinese (to further inspire me to learn Chinese)
night:
work on Studio Mercato games (outside, cafes, hostel, travelling, in transit)
- one month of Crystal Brawl
work on personal games (outside, cafes, hostel, travelling, in transit)
- one week per prototype, then playtest
run events for experiencing and making (see below)
write blogs of my experiences
- translate to Chinese

late night:
once per week:
- see cool teaching jobs in Taipei, aim for high pay and low commute
- check for really good jobs around the world, priority for NY
-- wait until games are done!

weekends:
- get the fuck out, travel like a bum, empiricism

further reading:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game
  - plaything, puzzle, competition
  - Crawford's definition may thus be rendered as[original research?]: an interactive, goal-oriented activity, with active agents to play against, in which players (including active agents) can interfere with each other.

current thoughts:
- why am I in Taiwan?
-- If I cannot answer this, I should not be learning Chinese.
-- I chose the country after a year of travel because I love it: the people are more social and physical, they are also more traditional and therefore interesting (at the surface), the weather is hot which increases my willpower, it's easier to change from work mode to travel mode (although more difficult to enter work mode), resulting in a happier life (initial thought). Unfortunately I've found that the weather is bad from December to March, making it quite unbearable, especially without enough strong social connections.
-- The first two months was pure travel. The next three months was a heart-pounding social bliss and anxiousness: looking for ways to socially connect through play (talking with classmates, going out, exploring Taipei, exploring Chinese fine art), leading to Humans of Taipei. Now, without warm weather and an inclination to be social, I find no reason to wake up and go to Chinese class. [an aside: do multi-lingual Asians learn other languages because they are social and curious, or lack willpower?]
-- Should I focus on finding reason to learn Chinese, and use that as a reason to be social? Was it my current path of making games alone on a computer that destroyed my interest?
-- conclusion: try a light therapy lamp [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_affective_disorder] and eat fish. Continue with introversion. Share ideas with close friends. Maximize free (personal work) time by choosing a job with a high money/work ratio. Even Ludwig Wittgenstein learned Norwegian to converse with local villagers.

- must choose game or film, or, do one, and then the other. Or is it experience and not experience (computer work)? There is no way to balance both. And to start games in Taiwan is quite difficult and/or lonely without a community or enough art friends. Perhaps Humans / Vincent Moon / documentary style things makes more sense.

- to do game, I have to create a community. I have to be social about what I do.

- fuck everybody do your own shit mode vs highly observational interesting in everyone mode?
-- does the weather determine this? Or was it because I moved to an apartment, alone?
--- seems I really need a shared apartment to remind myself to be more social, social without a connection to a goal, although, learning Chinese <em>was</em> a goal.

- need to research climate, isolation, social norms, social organization, and blog about my travels

blogs:
- three months in Taipei, maximizing life experience, learning through play, living through play, and misinterpreting learning, narrow focus, a care for others with an inability to do anything positive outcomes, Tsai Ming-Liang and Hirokazu Koreeda, poor people, cultures, differences
- the effects of climate, seasonal affective disorder, heat and extrovert and sensing, cold and introvert thinking
- current feeling
- see thoughts and write a blog for each country, see pictures too

currently hosting events:
Taipei Game Club / 台北遊戲俱樂部
- why? Because I think Taiwan has a very street oriented culture, fitting for the development of really street games that are physical, social, and fun
- base it off NYU Game Center and Parson's Game Club
-- format: 1. play a game (1 hour). 2. talk. express a certain direction in games. 3. playtest each others games (allow every participant to playtest each other's game). 4. socialize
-- need to watch more videos from these two organizations
- goal: create Babycastles Taiwan
- other goals: create physical games, street games, start come out and play Taiwan?
- week 1: Physical games pt.1

-- IGF勝利者，一起玩: Device 6, Crypt of the NecroDancer (按下按鈕?)

-- 

street game jam
- based off of come out and play jam
- outside
- near a flea market or a place where you can buy funky things

? film jam
- weekends
- base it off of 48hour film festival for deadline?

- Urban Nomad has a short film contest due 3/3*
- where to advertise? Meetup.com? NTU? Urban Nomad Film Festival Facebook - sponsored meetup!
-- proposed to Urban Nomad Film Festival
--- fuck you Taiwan art people.
- goal: create a film studio like Tsai Ming-Liang

? film club
- does an event of consumption have any benefit, when compared to a creative event?
- base it off of rooftop films
- start it, then let others run it, just curate films, start with local and/or film festival winners
- ask hackerspace for projector and extension cord, find wall and grass
-- no projector at hackerspace

to explore:
center of Taiwan
islands of Taiwan
east coast, again
Beitou - hot spring
Xindian
New Taipei City
more of Wenhua
the streets

My current todo list:
- order a light therapy lamp*
- wake up at 9am everyday?, leave house by 10am. Mandatory for street life!
- maintain relationships
- not be broke
- be social everyday
- maintain playfulness
- maintain priority for high-art (surround self with life and art, struggle)
-- how to work and struggle simultaneously?
--- films?
- travel every weekend
-- play after work--Humans of Taiwan, Vincent Moon, document, design, walk, scooter, bike, talk, experience life not media
- live in Taiwan for another six months I'M LIVIN' IT
- find cheap studio to live in or a shared apartment with Taiwanese roommates I'M LIVING IN IT
-- commercial studios don't have showers
-- spaces in the city exist for events, but probably wouldn't be suitable for personal exhibitions
--- eh, make it happen in public spaces!
-- furnish it minimally
--- local flea markets and thrift store day! Buy silly Chinese knick-knacks.
---- fortune cat
---- red and black fortune words
--- portable speaker
--- buy a whiteboard and copy this list to it
--- write high-art ideas on it to remind self to never lower standards
--- post images of Humans of New York, Vincent Moon, favorite film directors, games being played, etc. on the walls
- continue Chinese at current pace -- intense classes at a mandarin learning center DOING IT
-- after second book, self-study and find tutor to ask questions once a week (or Rice)
- teach part-time CURRENTLY HERE
- learn French? IMPRACTICAL
- continue Humans of Taiwan
-- a precursor to street films?
- make a personal game
- blog designs
- blog thoughts while traveling
- Facebook travel pictures

- game route (during winter, not fun):
- continue Crystal Brawl at current pace -- one sitting per weekday DOING IT
- make digitally distributed physical games series
- hurrah for Unity 2D!
- studio vs shared apartment?
-- hackerspace and FABLAB are nice spaces to run game events from
---- also a good place to make stuff
----- make an arcade cabinet here!
------ commission a wood working artist to help build, paint, or design it
-- random locations in the city are good enough meeting points for film jams
-- a studio is only needed for a public arcade, which can wait until I make enough machines
--- can put a machine in a day/night market's arcade or a storefront tea shop
-- events wouldn't feel as intimate if it were in my own studio
--- can run public film and game consumption events at my shared apartment
- FIND WAYS TO HAVE FUN WHILE MAKING GAMES, PROBABLY BY GETTING PEOPLE TO JOIN ME
-- create a game community
-- open a public arcade
-- run a game design jam
-- run a physical game jam
--- PHYSICAL, PUBLIC GAMES IS TAIWAN'S STRENGTH AND FUTURE IN ART
---- games that can be played at the night market
---- games that can be played in the subway, buses, and trains, on terraces, streets, and parks
-- run a local train jam
- create a fine art piece (likely new media, public, large-scale)

- film route (after game route, or during summer?, after I finish games? after I have money?):
- find a similar-minded filmmaker and make another film about my observations during my time on the streets of Taipei during the previous three months
-- start a film jam in a local, public place to create a team to make films with
- continue Humans of Taiwan and start Vincent Moon-esque documentation to continue observing

- put in hours into a local NGO
- determine if I have enough local collaborators to live in Taipei. If not, go to New York.
- determine if I can balance work and life. If not, try master’s (in New York).

- end goals:
- create a new media studio
- or, live on the streets, and make films about it
