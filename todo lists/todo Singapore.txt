to Kuala Lampur:
  - bus direct
  - bus transfer at Johor Bahru, ~$? to Johor, ~$1 to terminal, ~$? to KL
  - flight
  - train (7 hours)

come back to Singapore later to couch surf and leave through airport
or just take a flight from Kuala Lumpur, likely connecting to Singapore, and nearly as cheap
