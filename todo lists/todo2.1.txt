a sticky note:
fix versions of text files on Dropbox
  - need wifi :(
upload / delete photos
***communicate!**
***local environment is everything**

[todo: to survival.txt]
sleep near a showering facility
must lay down, or else body fluids will build up in the foot
no mosquitos
in the sun (for warmth, unless it’s too hot)

scooter around farms, pitching a tent anywhere

[todo: to ideas.txt or create daydreams.txt]
Japan dream, Kumiko hostel [? don’t entirely remember. Maybe just working at a hostel with Kumiko.]

[note: copied to thoughts]
self vs people?
  - **self**, fuck people / culture, do work, believe nothing else, fuck communication

a sticky note:
1. get a programming jobs in NY / VA
  - save money — **can do anything with money**
2. dive master / jobs? Science gigs?
  - where in Asia?
3. First Aid / Emergency training -> EMT -> paramedic (-> field medic) or firefighter path
4. Engineering, basic?
  - ? build houses? Disaster relief? Volunteer!
    - this kind of labor seems a bit of a dead end. Construction is a quite popular wage labor amongst migrant workers

all of these are good, physical jobs, which makes me happy, as it keeps me outdoors, stimulated, excited.

*** **self-organize in developing areas**

can start eco-tourism, govern via crowdfunding, etc.

dream of living on lanyu
  - build house

[todo: still have more on sticky note, and on the back of it]

after lanyu, in pingdong county:

mother as culture-carrier
  - no books, lack of intelligence makes it difficult to get information
  - location of food
    - how to retrieve said food
    - how to cook it

try Chinese websites / self-motivated

body: self-sufficiency -> advanced work
  - [hmmm, this is kinda the dream isn’t it? Be self-sufficient, then do what you want.]

mind: always philosophy

daydream of starting plant-material / herbology vendor (aloe vera, etc.), bamboo rods, berry juice, etc.

distributing supplies to the homeless, slum-dwellers, and poor outside of taipei
  - redistribute supplies from rich to poor, the necessities to go from homeless to working in a capitalist economy, use physical signs in rich neighborhoods, ask for necessities (food container, old bicycles [and cost to repair], umbrellas, sleeping mats, mosquito spray)
  - or use crowd-sourcing websites as opposed to physical signs

現在的做事表:
圖書館太冷，我應該用我的手機找一找吧。我總是覺得冷，然後就睡覺。這樣，我沒辦法找工作！我可以去其他的圖書館做事。還是，我變了太爛。

在圖書館可以借書！post-modern，什麼的。文化的theory，人的ecology，人的地學，之類。

Hostelbookers:
  - no reviews? What happened?

conclusion: [added at a much later time, while reviewing old todo items]
Hostels are money-whores. They exploit workers for their property for “experience”. Also, they don’t risk short-term workers, or even accept. Patrick Faltermann was right.

2.  在圖書館104 temp jobs
  - 臨時工/短
  - 1. check hostels
  - 2. check cafes, bars, foreign restaurants

  - https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?act=url&depth=1&hl=zh-TW&ie=UTF8&prev=_t&rurl=translate.google.com&sl=zh-CN&tl=en&u=https://www.104.com.tw/job/%3Fjobno%3D3jhnc%26jobsource%3D104_sjob&usg=ALkJrhjDCZayvDQyAlsT1Z6b87UBRUjrLQ
    - japanese restaurant in an old house in daan district


How to get out of poverty trap? Proof that digital communication is meaningless.
  - go to day and night markets, ask for jobs
    - 1. raohe, 2. tonghua, 3. shida?


 
conclusion: [added at a much later time, while reviewing old todo items]
104 jobs are terrible, just companies desperate for workers. Need to just travel, socialize, then find.

  - Taipei work vs more rural work?
  - as long as it is labor, it might be okay.* [todo: add to thoughts.txt]

Read geography books

Ask restaurants and cafes for work online
Ask storefronts for work in favorite neighborhoods
  - 104 map it

From another old note:
Stay near schools; They are safety zones: they have free food, free accommodation, students, method of making money?
--

from a recent paper:
read Virginia Woolf's other work
read Harvey's The Postmodern Condition
read Henri Lefebevre's production of social space
  - basically the social philosophy of space, from epistemology to material

read one essay from Space, Place, and People Reader per day
  - take notes in Chinese
  - read some grammar
  - begin listening to book again
  - use phone to write in Chinese again
  - use radio to listen to Chinese?

Jobs at or with MIT
  - look other jobs within MIT Media Lab
  - Poverty Action Lab?
  - apply to others?
    - most are long-term :(
    - there was a cool one about maintaining multiple libraries! Maintaining spaces is great, like a hostel, but education-oriented.

Look for programming jobs in NY? 2d games only.
  - aim for remote jobs
  - otherwise, highest paying?

use 104 to find community hall like jobs for small towns
  - homeless, prostitution, prison, poor, etc.
  - social and urban
  - civil
  - [conclusion: nope. Taiwanese organizations are too stupid, and don’t have money or willpower to do anything.]

or create capital myself, creatively
  - commodity?
  - art?
  - property?
  - education?

from some old notes:
message Simon, tell relationship with BaiBai

write thoughts on relationships, essays :)
play the Witness, write a review / essay of my first 5 minutes with the game

  - message Baozi

eat fruit, rice, bread
  - [conclusion: nope, bread is kinda gross without toasting it, rice is also gross without some kind of sauce. Instant noodles, cold or hot are better. Yimian is better in soup. Indonesian instant noodle companies have the best flavors.]

easier to scooter along the beach*
  - check organizations, internet, FB groups
  - reverse trip
  - [conclusion: nope, just ask farms, and stick to shared living spaces]


At Gaoxiong?:
ask Fablab Gaoxiong for arcade cabinet material cost
tent in Taipei?
  - need to get tent from Yilan
  - contact Vinay, Emily, Pan, Max, Xintian, etc.


call schools / tutor gigs (need cash to invest in personal commodity business) / ghostwrite academic papers
vs
random 104 jobs
vs
local jobs
  - my location must feel good, a neighborhood, warm, hot springs, nature
  - perhaps a little school nearby to teach, or create a school
    - like poetic computing, can be done at a public space
  - need to be somewhat near the city? Not really. People will come.
  - Tainan vs Taipei
vs
remote work
  - may require recent programming work
  - self D&T
    - go to nature to gather material
    - wood, metal, etc., scavenge material

less travel, more alteration of the world

all of the above thought influenced by capitalism

nomadic summers, 
winter house crafting

Cash:
700ntd？
Need to buy a bowl and oatmeal or a bowl and instant noodles or sachimi (best, 100ntd for 10 meals, 15-20ntd per meal) from a larger store. also bread works too, at 30ntd for a loaf, even cheaper. Can buy jam or peanut butter if cheap enough. Need to catch a gig in our around Taipei. Could even be an hour away.

做無聊的事情：
p/用沙發客問很多台北的人
  - 再用一下，問多人, ask 5 more responsive people.
  - [conclusion: nope, CSers too are too scheduled, often can’t book on short notice, and, Taiwan CSers just don’t respond at all, even with a good account.]

At NTU:

明天：
Day:
-1。 Wonder the campus for food and nice spaces
  - or just wander the city, by preferably during the day
  - found master's room for architecture, urban planning, etc. Good Chinese people. Useless work, thankfully they are from architecture.
  - should wander some more. It's not a bad place to wander social groups. Perhaps there's philosophy? Public Affairs? National development?
    - new social sciences building but terrible politics, national development, and public affairs departments. Very book oriented. Also, their library also is strict, asking for passport.
    - philosophy
      - not on campus, mostly Chinese?
      - no, just eastern philosophy is, not bad, good freshman readings, anthropology student had condition of post-modernity, philosophy society's bookcase had several histories of western philosophy
1。再拿來錢
  - 2. 葉問他們，試試line of credit
    - need wifi

eBay我的東西
  - 在通化街，松山，看一下有些學校，什麼都工作可以，因為離我很近。那是最重要。

L。4. 看tfd的電郵
  - 送他們電郵，Joe0826kimo@tfd.org.tw，給他們打電話，說fuck you。
  - 0227080100

Thoughts on school organization vs city

Oral vs written, England and Taiwan
Social institution elitism
Minimum to live: 10ntd per meal, free ubike, 3ntd bus rides, walk, 7-11 hot water. Missing free places to shower. 7-11 with orange tube?
Feeling to stick to reality, affecting reality, practically, as in the urban planning books for less developed countries, being a nomadic civil engineer* (creating a civil engineer stack exchange). Fuck media (except films). Feel like affecting and being affected by reality again, to experience, to want to gain knowledge from the people around me, not media, as Peter said. I need to travel and experience again. But don't I need money? No. I just need to be willing to do some work, and enjoy it, for the time.

2. Pleco flash cards


Airbnb seems better than hostel websites.
  - 我沒有錢！

Airbnb;
Bon voyage
Can try finding cheapest Airbnb in taiwan

The cold is killing me, again
  - this is the largest problem in my life

1. Shower and poop at night, especially to avoid mosquitos

4. Do work on the buses:
  - 成功大學?
    - call chengda: 886 6 2757575 ext 54050
    - sure, but need money
    - creative industries is like design and technology: games, adding data to environment, social design, fine art, etc.
    - urban planning seems top down, lots of drawing, recreating cultural tourism
  - Travel more, plan less! Good weather for a week!
    - oh fuck, what happened? Eh, still okay during the days.
  - Have to go to places first, then find a place to sleep. Talk to people. Have to be very outgoing, willing to do any travel or work.
    - very difficult in the cold.
    - need working mindset
  - Apply for gigs in Taipei, Tainan, Taiwan
  - Find a hostel to work exchange

Future: apply for SF jobs, make games by myself, try Carona, or any modern 2d framework.ty

Need to organize, like don't starve, a home, money, and repeat? Bleh.

CS needs better communication

To blog:
Organization to media vs language, a modern American experience

Media vs urban life, cost, profit, sedentary private vs political other, knowledge vs action

I told her 「我想了關於她」。她回答了「我不知道怎麼反應」然後給我打電話，我們聊天，聊得很笨。When should a relationship feel intimate, and when should it feel like everyday life?

在高雄的做事表：

在早上：
4. 學中文
4. 用沙發衝浪，用中文。送人信，翻譯公共的報告 （屏東，台南，南投，苗栗，台北，宜蘭)

8. 問小豬沒時間聊天忘記？需要？最好是什麼？


Sleep early, use air conditioner, then feel like working or exercising, but must constantly go back to air conditioner. Don't laundry everyday (unless you create a habit of showering with clothes), use a washer dryer at a hostel or laundromat.

Simply need to go out and have an experience everyday.

Cooking
Instrument
一一， 暗殺 - 下載給小豬

Check film lists

Tomorrow: call banks, sell iPad and z4n (ask for 小豬's id), call home, buy flight, apply for schools and scholarships, apply for jobs in Taiwan? Can check boards). Or just tutor English in Taipei? Ride around Taiwan and then get back to Taipei. Tutor programming, philosophy, college entrance, art, etc. use extra time to create a space and run workshops.

Delete iBooks books, upload Chinese books. Can try voice dream.

Why Taipei? Can't I create my own space, use the Internet? Program remotely? Teach English remotely?

from old notes:
contact social organizations, through communication and physically

crossroad city comics and urban planning, experience the city and read Jane Jacobs and Christopher Alexander
illustrate urban problems

observe east coast societies

DIY Space - maps, materials, direction, Taiwan crafters / location, news to civil disobedience

Fuck institutions. Ride capitalism. Cook Indian food in cities, do workshops for money, do whatever. The enjoyment of doing and doing it socially.
Add Rorty's books to Dropbox. Add penguin books (symposium, meditations, etc.) to Dropbox, then playlist.

From thoughts 8-7.txt:
在農場工作？去城市？第一去農場，第二去城市/我的計畫（大的，小的，都可以）
  - 荷蘭，Ireland，都可以。
去旅行，用網路找附近的工作，couchsurf，什麼的。不可以工作免費。


Tutor in Taipei? Apartment in Taipei? Go around Taiwan again? Should join organizations and work along the way, creating new projects along the way.

問max，有地方快賣東西？可以住在他的家？問google。在台北有什麼地方？
[conclusion: Max is useless]

5. Homeostasis: 泡茶, thermals, exercise （a lot more!) and wake up in the sun.
8點起床。去外面，城市。有經驗了。
起床的時候：3。洗衣服4。打掃房間，4。MIT，5。grants,   6。 creative applications， 7。台灣的政府，8。 humans,，3。準備。FB。賣iPad。找教英文。找loan。付錢機車票？付錢台北圖書館？修理耳機。

Check NGOs? Check jobs? Check hackerspaces and civic spaces. Check schools. Go.

I'm quite interested in creating a civic space.

A letter to Division of Civic Organization: (save to gmail conversations)
I personally know technology and social organizations, but not of civic organizations.

Although I can continue to directly affect my neighborhood and the organizations I know in Taipei, I wonder, what is the general civic organization of Taipei (and if possible Taiwan)?

Is there some kind of meeting hall for each community or neighborhood? Are there technologies that citizens can use to make decisions or get involved (beyond e-services)? Can anyone access the several communities registered by the Division of Civic Organization? Does the government have public databases or maps? Are there ways to get funded for such a space?

My interests are in civic technology, which is broad, overlapping many of Taipei City government departments, so I feel the Division of Civic Organization might be a good place to start. Please do direct me to whatever person or website if possible!

[ temporary past ideas:
- crowdsource city data for public use in the form of many many maps
- ask MIT media lab's civic media research group for tools to use and help develop
- find a cheap apartment to live in, and use it as a public space. If not, hijack a public space for my own interests, which are likely for the public's interest.
- foster sharing to gain materials for creativity
- document local lives and share using physical media
- document local materials and share using physical media
- make local public spaces more livable

Unspam Trisha email [?]

JOBS:
台灣全部的NGOs。

。。。應該幫忙人，跟人做事，教書。比較社會的東西。比較創造的東西。

送giant的CEO，關於安全帽的一封信。kickstart it。

Temp3:
每天聽廣播！需要聽說話。這是生活。真的對我好。很容易聽，注意力分散

todo：
告訴耳機人，耳機的問題

10. Get illustrated version of A Pattern language and city building. Use iBooks or Marvin to read. Read and blog in Chinese.*
13. Create currently reading: my own thoughts, essays and my own experience. Download art as experience and city stuff.
15. Just do stuff! So much better.

To todo (or to buy?):
Mosquito net from Carrefour for 300nt
Get a better scooter
Bamboo mat from Catrefiur for 1000nt. (The 300nt one sucks)


Later:
Could write about ideals similar to A Pattern Language. It's a very good way to write a book of separate ideas building up. Need to go back to thoughts file and write everyday.*

Actually, my blog is exactly that. It starts with thoughts from my thoughts file and builds up from there, all the way up to ideals.

Todo; Clean up blog. Publish and clean all drafts. Use auto table of contents creator (see self-assessment). Use php to create a function to get posts from date to date.

Montaigne also wrote his essays in this way. After 49 years of life experience, he'd read something from Ancient times, such as Seneca, an ancient essayist. Once he stops to reflects on something he read, he'd use the quote and write. So simple.

Todo: need to write like Montaigne and Bacon.


早上：
第一，聽跟看。聽廣播（沒有意思的話不用），聽書，聽書跟看書 （下載書），聽跟看adventure time。找，看，台灣的新報。
第二：創造。用於法寫句子。打掃Pleco？需要句子，對話。

Taipei (or Tainan) English tutor gigs?
Live in hostel? Anywhere, but closer to a city or neighborhood.
One month. Can go to English schools door to door.
Tainan? Need Chinese class / mandarin center. Check weather. 蘭嶼？
NGOs*
Selling tea, and doing other local gigs is most appealing (because preference for self-learning). Stay local (because preference for not moving). But then I would need an apartment, locally, in a nice place, with the ability I create a public space.
Selling tea is only fun if I do it everyday, have friends, am out and about, able to think and act freely, not limited to making tea.

看書，寫書：
寫台北三個月的思想。理想的空間，城市，什麼的。台北的問題。*


現在的話：
Holy shit, worth getting Frame's translation of Montaigne in ePub form. Worth learning French for.

Reread Aristotle, Bacon, Calvino too, for this kind of thought

Taoism, in modern Chinese and English.

Dutch (Amsterdam and Belgium) and Irish (Ireland).

今天做什麼？：
2。去瀑布的地方走路。學中文的語法。聽書。
 - 用台灣的 Google，改變你的電腦，用中文。慢慢學？或看adventure time x 3! 然後用於法的筆記*。比較容易嗎？練習文法。下載PDF！lol*

4.3 job applications? (For money)
  - teach, science, tutor, etc.

在做/7。在租：
提醒：台灣的政法的學金。
4。去問問看，私立教書的地方*
5。問問看那茶店的老闆，在哪裡可以買茶大杯子，可不可以借？
付錢airbnb?用7-11。 多少錢？$13/night? 或買印度茶。

在晚上：
0. 看電影。 Level Five。
2. 下載Montaigne by Frame, Mongtaigne in French
1.寫MIT的文章，NTU需要嗎?, NTUA需要嗎？
拷貝什麼都東西

在八點多給開車執照打電話
網路上找英文教書的工作，在台灣嗎？日本？韓國？

用電腦賣書？放在這裡？pchome, eBay, ruten，買茶？ask mom to send with credit card, thin t-shirt, and more (see list).

在宜蘭準備錢？或在台北準備錢？我覺得台北比較容易。宜蘭比較舒服。每天應該去旅行吧。做東西。想。創造。

教英文準備錢所以我可以付錢住金，食物，做飯的東西。

Tutor English for enough money for rent, food, and cooking ingredients. Then sell Indian and Mexican food at a night market in bento boxes, or take ingredients and cook. Try different markets. Aim for $1000. Could be fun. Should be.*
  - Also need decent kitchen and space to store ingredient so.
  - 1. Tea
  - 2. Mexican - ask mom for recipe
  - 3. Indian food - ask mom for recipes
  - Catch fresh fish*
  - Make simple fishing rod, or buy one.

提醒什麼時候應該聲請大學。

Create self-work hostels. Ex. One near a natural job, in which people can self-learn and work a different job, to pay for the rent and life.
  - [whoa, so I did want to do this, way before Lanyu. Holy shit.]

86yuan.

out/用/練習中文。
  - meh, don't force with study, just use normally when thinking. Just live and talk to Taiwan (and avoid travelers). Only grammar drills are necessary.
home/2. 看adventure time and tutoring. The good life. :)
Teach or tutor in Japan, or Korea?



看冒險的時間最好練習。比看書好。可是跟新的此話，語法，我得自己練習。

溫豆漿，從花蓮到宜蘭騎機車需要多少天？
從這裡到台東搭便車有用嗎？火車，公車，那一個是比較便宜？420光，好可能有窗戶。545好可能沒有。
復興車。去花蓮換車到台東。

從台東上山峽路邊去花蓮。有時間的時候，經過太魯閣到宜蘭。在宜蘭把有的行李拿來。再一次拿來其他的行李.

To daily and to mandarin.txt:

--




from untitled.txt, mostly Yilan
(p/1) Today I must put items for sale. Or, (2) find a tutor gig in Yilan. I should put everything up for sale. Whatever sells first is enough to pay and get out. Maybe. I should pay $300 + $300. Hmm maybe I do need to sell everything. That is the minimum to get out. I might have (i/3) $50 from Cathay, but it takes time, and I must pay Capital One $25. I also need some for fees. So I can't use any money I have in Wells Fargo. (x/-1) I could check if I can redeem cash from credit card and use that to pay itself.

(4) add mostly care for health, safety, and accessibility to MIT application, especially through urban planning.

Next I pack and go south. Check weather. Check social organizations and call.

Sell z4n? No. eBay vs 儒天 vs Yahoo vs PCHome. eBay may be best with my reputation. The others probably require Taiwan ID.


Then I must catch gigs along the way, with $150 for a flight out and in Taiwan again. For that, I should only begin to worry about that starting in January.

I may need to catch a tutor gig and camp at a small town, or outside of a city, until I feel like making my next move, whether it's organizing or not. Perhaps while traveling I will feel like doing other kinds of work: create websites for businesses, make films, make games, etc. Maybe I will want to take more direct actions, talk to people, live with people, change people. Dunno, but I do need that tiny bit of cash. I can use it for health check, x-ray, dental check, maybe even language school again? Nah. Not school, but application to MIT, NTU, etc. And more than cash I need to get out and get excited again, which means, talking, which means, be a part of an organization or city.
--

(*/5) Farming or tutoring nearby would be a way to at least pay for the hostel. Actually, any job is fine, as long as it is temporary. I don't mind, for the moment. It's neither meaningful or creative, but some work is helpful through convenience.

An easy way out is to just teach, but that goes against a lot of my ideals. 60000ntd* is enough money for 6 months of rent though. Difficult to go against this. If there is a one to three month gig in Taipei, this may be the best way to go. (6) Check ESL websites and try, then can go around Taiwan as planned, then school, etc.

Ah, forgot about asking banks for loans. (c/7) Can ask Charles Schwab, but that means I would have to get a job much quicker rather than travel cheaply and slowly. Or, start the organization / Air BnB / food stall much quicker, which requires time to find a good apartment. Hmm. Could try food stall again, in Taipei. Could try tutoring and/or part-time teaching and just pay the loan off ASAP.

Eh, looking at teaching English, it sounds dreadful, and a trap, as I won't be engaged in Taiwan culture. I would be separated. The up point is that full time pays $2000 per month.

Perhaps it is better to just sell tea and food after all*, to stay independent. Shit. But then need to find an illegal spot, or a cheap legal one, which also takes a bit of time. Also take a short period of time cooking and experimenting, which doubles as my own meal.

Farming is also better than teaching. I also thought about some more fun jobs: bicycle repair and motorcycle repair, coffee barista, and something else. The first two skills are quite useful.

I checked the salary of Taiwan jobs on 104, it's terrible. I'd rather do these simple gigs in a city, or a small town for a short period of time, and slowly move back to the city. To get paid, one needs to work for a foreign company.

I thought about getting a gig in San Francisco or New York, cash out, and come back to Taiwan and begin independently living cheaply off of repairs, hospitality, and whatever other silly money making gigs. But that goes against my notion of landing in the place, making friends, and settling among them. SF and NY gigs are temporary. But perhaps that is because I am thinking of office gigs, and not more fun things like that hostel I saw, and community work. That kind of work would be excellent, and not sacrifice my time on unvalued things.

The best option is to actually just get out and go. Go south for warmth, camp near a library and beach. It's ok. As long as one is out, one can easily go to towns, find jobs, etc, it's a matter of getting out of Yilan, this cold and rainy place. To help me get out, I should hike and get a bit of sun at 10:30am, anywhere, not using scooter.

I thought about San Francisco again, but it seems they need current people to work permanently. Again, I don't quite look forward to that kind of work. It's takes time and life away, even if it is in a nice environment. It's much better to do a social job in a city with nice weather, say, San Diego, Hawaii, etc. Avoid programming in a big city, it's a total waste, not a method of gaining money fast. It's lifeless. Work at a hostel, art communities, schools, public jobs that take place outside; These are more flexible, fun, social, and allows me to see the bigger picture, have a sense of community, real people, without focusing on a computer all day.

But for now, in Taiwan, just go South and see what I get. It doesn't matter what it is, as long as it is temporary, social, fun. Not too much commitment. Try to save enough money to go to New Zealand to farm and do other labor gigs. Then can go between Australia and New Zealand. Then travel again, or school, or anything.

"I dropped off my CV everywhere, from toy stores to nightclubs.  But in the end, I decided to do the one thing I had vowed I would never do – teach English."

"Most days, I felt more like an actress (or a con artist) than a professor.  Some days, I felt like a complete ass."

Loans:
Dad
Wells Fargo credit line. Have an APR, quite high, 9-18%? Instant loan, depending on amount, and can then transfer to Schwab (2 days), then get cash. No worry about payments, but have APR.

Wells Fargo 0% APR credit card, but would need to pay minimum on time, and very likely, there is APR on cash advance, so have to purchase PayPal.
  - can use PayPal to make a purchase (3% commission) by creating another account. One with bank, one with credit card. These transfers would be done near instantly because it is credit.

Cheapest option seems to be to use 0% APR card with PayPal, as it wastes the least money (no APR and possibility of no transfer fee, but likely 3% transfer fee)

PayPal has a debit card*
  - not bad, $1.5 atm fee, 1% transaction fee (purchase and withdrawal)
  - instant funds, no transfer fee? Maybe, from WF to PayPal.

The most convenient option is the credit line, taking only how much I need. (Todo: ask if it requires a minimum payments, also ask actual APR).

Check FB and not turn off notifications.

from laptop:
buy multi-grain rice (eat with 7-11 egg and vitamin)
  - oatmeal is more travel friendly as it can be quickly cooked wherever there is hot water, which includes 7-11s
  - add to to buy list: portable stove
pack and sell everything:
  - sell film equipment*
pay debts
  - air bnb
  - Dad
create and travel again!
  - go south and do some gigs, do whatever, as long as it's temporary and pays well. Need $150 ASAP
call home
begin Chinese study

I'm quite interested in creating a civic space.

A letter to Division of Civic Organization: (save to gmail conversations)
I personally know technology and social organizations, but not of civic organizations.

Although I can continue to directly affect my neighborhood and the organizations I know in Taipei, I wonder, what is the general civic organization of Taipei (and if possible Taiwan)?

Is there some kind of meeting hall for each community or neighborhood? Are there technologies that citizens can use to make decisions or get involved (beyond e-services)? Can anyone access the several communities registered by the Division of Civic Organization? Does the government have public databases or maps? Are there ways to get funded for such a space?

My interests are in civic technology, which is broad, overlapping many of Taipei City government departments, so I feel the Division of Civic Organization might be a good place to start. Please do direct me to whatever person or website if possible!

Could write about ideals similar to A Pattern Language. It's a very good way to write a book of separate ideas building up. Need to go back to thoughts file and write everyday.*

Actually, my blog is exactly that. It starts with thoughts from my thoughts file and builds up from there, all the way up to ideals.

Todo; Clean up blog. Publish and clean all drafts. Use auto table of contents creator (see self-assessment). Use php to create a function to get posts from date to date.

Montaigne also wrote his essays in this way. After 49 years of life experience, he'd read something from Ancient times, such as Seneca, an ancient essayist. Once he stops to reflects on something he read, he'd use the quote and write. So simple.

Todo: need to write like Montaigne and Bacon.


早上：
第一，聽跟看。聽廣播（沒有意思的話不用），聽書，聽書跟看書 （下載書），聽跟看adventure time。找，看，台灣的新報。
第二：創造。用於法寫句子。打掃Pleco？需要句子，對話。

Taipei (or Tainan) English tutor gigs?
Live in hostel? Anywhere, but closer to a city or neighborhood.
One month. Can go to English schools door to door.
Tainan? Need Chinese class / mandarin center. Check weather. 蘭嶼？
104 job bank.
  - NGOs*
Selling tea, and doing other local gigs is most appealing (because preference for self-learning). Stay local (because preference for not moving). But then I would need an apartment, locally, in a nice place, with the ability I create a public space.
Selling tea is only fun if I do it everyday, have friends, am out and about, able to think and act freely, not limited to making tea.

看書，寫書：
寫台北三個月的思想。理想的空間，城市，什麼的。台北的問題。*

To notes:
Sent email to NTU graduate urban institute to ask about Chinese test deadline.


現在的話：
Holy shit, worth getting Frame's translation of Montaigne in ePub form. Worth learning French for.

Reread Aristotle, Bacon, Calvino too, for this kind of thought

Taoism, in modern Chinese and English.

Dutch (Amsterdam and Belgium) and Irish (Ireland).

今天做什麼？：
2。去瀑布的地方走路。學中文的語法。聽書。
 - 用台灣的 Google，改變你的電腦，用中文。慢慢學？或看adventure time x 3! 然後用於法的筆記*。比較容易嗎？練習文法。下載PDF！lol*

4.3 job applications? (For money)
  - teach, science, tutor, etc.

在做/7。在租：
提醒：台灣的政法的學金。
4。去問問看，私立教書的地方*
5。問問看那茶店的老闆，在哪裡可以買茶大杯子，可不可以借？
付錢airbnb?用7-11。 多少錢？$13/night? 或買印度茶。

在晚上：
0. 看電影。 Level Five。
2. 下載Montaigne by Frame, Mongtaigne in French
1.寫MIT的文章，NTU需要嗎?, NTUA需要嗎？
拷貝什麼都東西

在八點多給開車執照打電話
網路上找英文教書的工作，在台灣嗎？日本？韓國？

用電腦賣書？放在這裡？pchome, eBay, ruten，買茶？ask mom to send with credit card, thin t-shirt, and more (see list).

在宜蘭準備錢？或在台北準備錢？我覺得台北比較容易。宜蘭比較舒服。每天應該去旅行吧。做東西。想。創造。

教英文準備錢所以我可以付錢住金，食物，做飯的東西。

Tutor English for enough money for rent, food, and cooking ingredients. Then sell Indian and Mexican food at a night market in bento boxes, or take ingredients and cook. Try different markets. Aim for $1000. Could be fun. Should be.*
  - Also need decent kitchen and space to store ingredient so.
  - 1. Tea
  - 2. Mexican - ask mom for recipe
  - 3. Indian food - ask mom for recipes
  - Catch fresh fish*
  - Make simple fishing rod, or buy one.

提醒什麼時候應該聲請大學。

Create self-work hostels. Ex. One near a natural job, in which people can self-learn and work a different job, to pay for the rent and life.

86yuan.

out/用/練習中文。
  - meh, don't force with study, just use normally when thinking. Just live and talk to Taiwan (and avoid travelers). Only grammar drills are necessary.
home/2. 看adventure time and tutoring. The good life. :)
home/3. 下載/試試聲音
Put self on tealit / find English gigs? Or do this in Japan, or Korea?

溫豆漿，從花蓮到宜蘭騎機車需要多少天？
從這裡到台東搭便車有用嗎？火車，公車，那一個是比較便宜？420光，好可能有窗戶。545好可能沒有。
復興車。去花蓮換車到台東。

從台東上山峽路邊去花蓮。有時間的時候，經過太魯閣到宜蘭。在宜蘭把有的行李拿來。再一次拿來其他的行李.

jobs to try:
local jobs (take care of environment, and people around me, outside, like handle bike system)
skill-based jobs (repair, craft, …?)

1. bicycle repair shop
  - sent email to Bikefarm, use Google Maps and find a few around Yilan, high-rated?
2. motorcycle repair shop (probably difficult to buy parts)
  - sent email to Bikefarm, use Google Maps and find a few around Yilan, high-rated?
  - [a note from the future: I think he said it was a shit job to get into, most are unwilling to teach, and really have to just luck out on finding a nice person.]
3. farming
  - ?
4. coffee maker
  - high-rated coffee in Yilan?

http://www.104.com.tw/job/?jobno=3kx1j&jobsource=n104bank1&hotjob_chr=
   - bike in taipei, bike maintenance and computer maintenance

http://www.104.com.tw/job/?jobno=3yktk&jobsource=n104bank1&hotjob_chr=
  - yilan bike shop

http://www.104.com.tw/job/?jobno=4339j&jobsource=n104bank1
  - yilan coffee shop

http://www.104.com.tw/job/?jobno=4339j&jobsource=n104bank1
  - coffee bar in yilan

ugh, just go to the places. fucking being poor and using computers.


todo:
create 104 account
go outside and wonder?

p/3. ebay iPad, film equipment (take pictures, need 10,000NTD) vs loan vs teach
  - ebay first, part time job (could be tutoring gigs) second* (this is the best option as I wouldn’t have to sell or loan anything, as proved by Into the Wild, even working at a fast food place!), loan third
  - loan: ask all three banks and compare: 1. Schwab, 2. Capital One, 3. Wells Fargo
*. check tutor gigs / schools in Taipei
  - save money in Taipei, live in hostel, then travel, then come back?
3.1 complain about Cathay airlines
3.2 find tutor English, or anything really. But I feel I should get out of the hostel, work somewhere. But finding a place to sleep is rough too. Hmmm. The limit of being within proximity to the hostel is destroying me, or, my inability to get out of the hostel during the day, or, the terrible rainy weather. I should just farm with the vegetarian lady. I should check local papers for local gigs, or use 591 to catch a gig.
c/4. MIT
x/5. other grants
  - could not find individual civil grants
  - can try UNDEF, NED, but do it after I’m packed, or in a library later.
7. Simon, Apple
8. go south vs Taipei
  - south for weather / warm place to camp, and farm, or whatever gig I find
  - get enough money to get to a farm in New Zealand or Austrailia****
    - this is kind of my Alaska now. :)

from old notes:
- call Raymond and Jason and home. Tell them I reached there fine.
- reply to bike buyer*
c/- Parson’s refund follow-up
  - check actual date of exit, see if it can be fought for. Nope left second Thursday, should be charred 10% ($2234) or 20% ($4468)? Through second week is 20%, darn. well, it was 3840, “You were charged 20% of the $21,585 tuition and the $138 fees”
  - p/sent mail asking to adjust the exit guidelines
- tell Suresh uncle to ship USB drive to Taiwan
- track money
- upload Lonely Planet books, China history, Chinese practice (upload to phone), kinda plan trip

- finish Communist Manifesto and Veblen
