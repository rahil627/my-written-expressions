the trip:
around Kyushu (Fukuoka, Oita, Miyazaki*, then continue around, Kagoshima, Kumamoto, Saga, Nagasaki, Fukuoka)
north toward Shikoku, passing through Shimane, Hiroshima, starting with Ehime, then go around (Ehime, Kochi, Tokushima, Kagawa)
escape north toward Tottori (or can choose toward Kobe / Osaka / Kyoto)
(Okayama?*)
(skipping Kansai’s Shiga, Mie, and Wakayama)
Gifu?** (mountains and Nagaragawa river)
continue north through the west coast (Fukui, Ishikawa, Toyama*, Yamagata, turn east for Miyagi* and Iwate, end at Aomori


thus far, it seems, Saitama, Gifu, Kyushu

  - East along the frequently deserted San’in coast, the old castle town of Hagi boasts a lovely cluster of samurai houses and atmospheric temples. Perhaps even more beautiful is Tsuwano, another small castle town nestling in a tranquil valley inland, further east in Shimane-ken. This prefecture is the heartland of Japan’s eight million Shinto deities, who are believed to gather each year in November at the ancient shrine Izumo Taisha, near the appealing capital of Matsue. Matsue has the region’s only original castle tower, as well as some old samurai houses and interesting museums. In neighbouring Tottori-ken you’ll find Mount Daisen, the highest peak in the Chūgoku region, with great hiking in the summer and skiing in winter.

If you only have a few days, aim to take in Kurashiki and Matsue, as well as Hiroshima and Miyajima. In a couple of weeks, you could make a circuit of both coasts taking in most of the region’s highlights.

chugoku region (western Honshu)

  - edo-era Tsumago and Magome (small towns between Tokyo and Kyoto)
  - Okayama / Shogawa River Valley (contains 3 hobbiton-like villages)
  - all of which is basically the Japan Alps, between November and April snow a lot

Saitama seems like Yilan for Tokyo
  - “Head further into the mountains to Nagatoro, a small but pretty town that takes full vantage of its position along the raging Arakawa river by offering a variety of outdoor sports from traditional river boating to whitewater rafting to paragliding. There’s camping, hot springs and other requisites for a proper outdoorsy weekend.”

Miyazaki
  - “Miyazaki is a mountainous and mango-growing prefecture to rival Okinawa in the tropical paradise stakes.”
…
“A consistently warm climate makes Miyazaki prefecture a perfect year-round getaway”
…
“Apparently blessed with the most hours of sunshine of any city in Japan, the prefectural capital of Miyazaki city is packed with (slightly retro) resort facilities facing out onto some of the best surfing conditions in the country. “


Tokyo - I need another full page to write about Tokyo.

Yamanashi - Hilly mountain country - must try grapes, pears, apples

Iwate - Rugged wild coastline dotted with fishing towns.

Hokkaido - Big flat terrain, grand blue sky.  The biggest prefecture, so it's hard to summarize in one sentence, but great food all around.  Home to SDF's only armored division if you are into that kind of thing. 

Kyoto - More historical sites then you can shake a stick at.  Word of caution, don't judge the beauty of the city by the immediate vicinity of the station.  Modern urban planning did an awful job there.
  - interesting

Osaka - Big city.  Japanese love the cheap street food to be found here.  Ask a local.
  - best big city street culture?

Okayama - Heavy industry

Ehime - Sunny, known for it's oranges
  - :)

Fukuoka - Yakuza country.  While these gentlemen of the underworld can be found across Japan, disproportionate numbers come from here and the surrounding area.  You come across news like a fourth grader finding a handgrenade in the rice patty, and police impounding latest Russian RPG 26 in a warehouse etc.  
  - maybe like Gaoxiong?

Tohoku in general being country bumpkins (the prefectures of Akita, Aomori, Fukushima, Iwate, Miyagi and Yamagata).




https://ampontan.wordpress.com/2007/09/21/japanese-personality-types-by-region/
  - Hokkaido

One possibility: Hokkaido was not widely settled by indigenous Japanese until the 19th century. The situation is analogous to the settlement of the American West. Perhaps a residual frontier spirit is the reason for the more assertive women.

  - Yamagata
If you like to sleep and eat ramen and hate automobile seatbelts, this is the place for you.

  - Tochigi
Detest karaoke? Don’t go near Tochigi—they love it.
  - lol

The reason for the crime rate is found in the extreme concentration of heavy industry in the Kokura district of Kitakyushu. The huge factories and smokestacks are easily visible from the train window. (Americans: Think Gary, Indiana and you’ll get the idea.) In fact, the second atomic bomb dropped on Japan was intended for Kokura. They were lucky the cloud cover over the city that day caused the bomber’s crew to head for the secondary target of Nagasaki.
  - Hampton Roads, crime, etc., nothing wrong with Fukuoka

—
https://www.japantoday.com/category/kuchikomi/view/each-prefecture-breeds-a-different-personality-type
  - Hokkaido* people are outgoing and hospitable
  - Tokyo? Full of country bumpkins giving themselves big-city airs.
    - haha

Bosses, meanwhile, prefer underlings from the opposite end of the country – Kagoshima. Like Yamaguchi, Kagoshima boasts samurai virtues, notably bravery and a strong sense of hierarchy. These keep obedient noses to the grindstone. Miyazaki Prefecture, though next door, has an altogether different ambience – warm, easygoing, optimistic. That’s good, too, in its way, and Miyazaki comes in second in rearing good subordinates.

The bosses from hell are likely to come from either Tottori Prefecture (worst) or Kyoto (second worst). Tottori has long winters, Kyoto a long history. The one induces stolid, blunt-spoken endurance, the other arrogance.

https://blog.gaijinpot.com/japanese-regional-stereotypes/
Similarly, the stereotype that Osaka people are all fun loving people comes in part from the dominance of the city on Japan’s comedy circuit.

Kyoto people are said to have an air of sophistication or even superiority, and there is no doubt that people say this because of its historical position as the centre of Japanese culture.

In the past, Tokyo was the political center of Japan. It was dominated by Samurai culture; a culture based on formality and respect. Osaka meanwhile, became the trading and commercial center of the country. This difference may have influenced the two cities’ stereotypes;

from comments:
Osaka; loud, direct, jokes, funny, cheap, Chinese of Japan.
  - perfect?

Hiroshima & Shikoku; a big unknown

Fukuoka; prostitues, fashionable (conservative fashion but not crazy like tokyo), beautiful girls.
  - hmm Yakuza problem?

The Hokkaido fellas I knew wanted me to know that theyre all hippies up there too
  - yay

  - Osaka.
We have Takoyaki, and Okonomiyaki.
  - yessss, street food

Fukuoka
  - …(I think the highest per capita in Japan for Yakitori places and Beauty Salons.)
    - hmm not bad to contend for Osaka’s street food
   …t's not terribly expensive to live in, either, though our subway system is mostly retarded and fairly expensive. (I'm looking at you Nanakuma line.)

    - also best ramen

https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/feb/24/japan-street-food-kyoto-tokyo

  - “Aichi.
We got that red miso and that miso katsu, son. Stop on by!
Edit: Also some of the (I think actually THE) worst drivers in Japan!”
    - lolol

  - I lived in Kouchi Ken. Inaka. Inaka for people who live in inaka. And I lived on one of the furthest capes.
Old people, mountains and forest are things that we have in abundance. And stunning coastline. And crystal clear rivers. I am not kidding, metres deep and it looks like you can dip your finger in and touch the bottom. Surfing beaches with honest to God waves and proper sand. Beer. Lots of beer and very, very friendly people. Charred bonito with garlic.
Before I went there I had never heard of it. Now I feel blessed I had the chance to live there.\\

  …Just how I like it :) that's the good thing about JET; they stick you in way out places you would never dream of going. Being so inaka, we got pretty involved in the community and did soooo much more cool stuff than urban JETs.
I remember being in Tokyo one long weekend, and the next, back in my area, digging up mountain potatoes on an old dudes farm, prepping them next to a cage of wild boars and then having a big BBQ at his hand built log cabin perched on the escarpment overlooking the ocean. It had futons for everyone, a massive wooden deck with a tree growing through it and a rope swing, a telescope for star gazing, high powered binoculars for watching the fishing boats come in an a bath made from an old fibreglass commercial fish tank that extended out over the escarpment . . . it was a completely different world and I knew where I would rather be :)

  - Gunma, need a car

  - Fukushima. It's got some of the best hiking and nature in the country. It's absolutely beautiful. Between Mount Bandai, Mount Azuma, and Oze National Park, we've got some of the best scenery you can ask for.

  - Rain rain rain rain, sunny sunny, rain rain, snow snow snow, rain, sunny sunny. Hyogo.
    - lolol

  - I live in Kagawa. It's the smallest prefecture in landmass and is famous for Ritsurinpark and udon which I can vouch for because I hated udon before, but it's super good here. Kagawa has a big modern art scene and Takamatsu is a decent city especially if you're not a big city kind of person. People here are generally friendly but kind of overestimate their worldliness. It's not too hard to make day trips to Kobe or Osaka or Okayama or the other prefectures on Shikoku but you will have to drive for at least two hours no matter where you go outside of the prefecture. There's a decent airport here though. Also the food isn't anything to brag about. Outside of udon everything is kind of standard tasting and a little expensive since most off their ingredients come from outside the prefecture. But I really love it here and I wouldn't mind staying here forever.

  - Tochigi. We have the worst drivers in all of Japan.

  - Kakoshimaaa! [Kagoshima] Such a beautiful place. Ibusuki feels like Maui but with darker sand and everything is ghetto.


  - I live in Tokyo. There are a lot of people here. The public transportation is very nice. It's the only city in the world where I've been assaulted.


http://www.japan-guide.com/forum/quereadisplay.html?0+88288
  - avoid: Niigata (car-made city), Fukui, Saitama (the suburban side), Aichi, Nagoya, Nara?
  - Niigata is full of rural charm, but it, like most of the Japan Sea side is depopulating seriously which can make it quite sabishii.
  - “Probably many people in Osaka would agree, but the best thing to seen in Osaka is people.”
  - Instead of wasting time for this type of question, come to Kyushu. You will be welcome by the warm heart & down to earth people.
  - many of these are listed as conservative values

http://www.japantrends.com/ibaraki-least-popular-prefecture/
The top five prefectures come as no surprise. Hokkaido is once again awarded the title of the most appealing prefecture in Japan, the title it has owned since the research started. Kyoto comes in second, followed by Okinawa, Tokyo and Kanagawa. We would probably get the same list of prefectures (though the order might vary a little bit) if we asked the same question anywhere in the world.

Private universities, however, tend to have different profiles, including strengths in education and in the humanities which are not reflected in this ranking. Thus in a list of the truly best, Waseda and Keio would probably belong near the top

Japan has more than 2,000 fishing ports, including Nagasaki, in southwest Kyūshū; Otaru, Kushiro, and Abashiri in Hokkaidō. Major fishing ports on the Pacific coast of Honshū include, Hachinohe, Kesennuma, and Ishinomaki along the Sanriku coast, as well as Choshi, Yaizu, Shimizu, and Misaki to the east and south of Tokyo.
  - most of the are on the east side, the main island, north east coast down until east of Tokyo

http://www.seafoodsource.com/commentary/top-17-fishing-ports-in-japan-listed
  - Makurazaki and Kagoshima (southern tip of Kyushu

http://www.wa-pedia.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-19816.html
  - I have been to Kyushu, Chugoku, Shikoku, Kansai, Nagoya, Kanto and Hokkaido. Among the cities I have visited, I'd say that the most liveable outside Tokyo are Sapporo and Fukuoka. The Japanese often say it, but I confirm it.
  - Fukuoka (Kyushu), Sapporo [2m], Matsuyama (Shikoku) [500k]
  - another person says Kochi City [350k] (Shikoku), Kobe [1.5m]

Just choose any small town with a population of around 50000 to 100000.

Personally, I would pick on climate :)

http://www.japan-guide.com/forum/quereadisplay.html?0+82528
  - Personally I also felt that Tokyo or Osaka would be too urban for my liking. When I was in Kyoto I felt that perfect combination of big city and small town. I once told my gf that if we were to live in Japan someday I'd want it to be Kyoto. They have about 1 million inhabitants.
Also, if you are aiming for a real suburb, I wouldn't recommend it. I've been to a few around Tokyo and there is simply nothing to do. The streets are totally deserted most of the day. The only thing you'd find is bored high-school students. Typically there is one huge shopping mall in the middle of the town and that's about it. If I were you I would not go to one of those suburb places.
  - Hello,
My favorite Urban yet near the country area is Oita prefecture. It has Fukuoka, Hakata, and Oita city, but also Beppu.

Pretty much all of Kyushu has a mix of Urban/Rural. :)
and also really beautiful nature.
Good luck to you!
/

  - Sapporo, hands down. I wouldn't want to live anywhere else.

If I bought a second home, I'd probably choose somewhere near Yonago City in Tottori prefecture. Possibly the most underrated part of Japan.



hmmm, maybe .5-1 million is the goal. 1.3 million in Tainan

wikitravel:
Kyushu (Fukuoka [1.4m], Kitakyushu [1m], Kagoshima [500k], Nagasaki, Miyazaki, Kumamoto, etc.)

Shikoku (Kochi [300k], etc.)
  - Shikoku is a primarily agricultural island, renowned for its citrus fruits. Cutting through the centre of the island is the mighty Yoshino river whose clear waters and big turbulent rapids make for great rafting.

Chogoku (Okayama 600k], mostly rural)
  - The region has the perfect climate for growing fruit, so the region is naturally famous throughout the nation for its delicious fruits.

White Peach (Okayama)
Muscat Grapes (Okayama)
Peone (Okayama)
Pears (Tottori)
Hanagosho Persimmons (Tottori)

Kansai (Osaka [2.5m], Kyoto [1.4m], Nara)


https://forum.gaijinpot.com/forum/living-in-japan/internet-technology/60170-what-are-the-5-best-cities-in-japan/page3
Sapporo and Ishigakijima for the easy going girls
Kumamoto for the warm and friendliness of its inhabitants, nature too

as for Osaka vs. Kobe: which is better for you depends on your stage of life. Osaka is dirty, stinky, loud, and sleazy, but if you're under 25 it won't bother you and you may even find it sort of lovable in a backwards kind of way. I thought Osaka was a lot more exciting than Kobe when I was studying abroad. I also feel as if Osaka was easy to have constant adventures in without a lot of money. 

Kobe undoubtedly has an objectively higher standard of life though; if you're 25+ and past the days when spending the night in a club is just as natural as spending it in your bed, you'll probably prefer Kobe's quiet elegance. It does take a proper salary to properly enjoy the best Kobe has to offer.

  - Little sidenote, which I found very special in Japan: There are many female truckers and they also stop sometimes, to give you a ride.
  - Hitchwiki says Tokio is not hitchable. I mean, it is true that you have NO SPACE AT ALL on the onramps. But hitchhiking works anyway. Awesome good, I have to say. I hitched three times on the Expressway from Tokyo and I waited not longer than 5 minutes. The second time I even got picked up together with two japanese hitchhikers that where waiting there with their signs. I mean, if the locals do it?
  - Between the north and the south is a huge climate difference. When we went to Shikoku island, there where pleasent 20° and spring time, while as two weeks later in the north was still heavy snow and in Hokkaido you even could make an iglo. Japan is big and the climate divers.

  - be polite, dress well, and go
  - Family Marts are the best place to dumpster dive
  - Lawsons have the best wifi
  - hitch positions: service area, in front of gas station; expressway, before the toll (interchange), country roads are the easiest and most fun, but slow

also a link from hitchwiki:
https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Urban_camping_in_Japan
  - Japan already has its own tradition of people (usually students) sleeping in train stations, on benches, etc., called nojuku.
  - The first thing you should ALWAYS do when arriving in a town or city you are planning to stay in is to go to the main train station, which will almost always have a tourist office inside or nearby. There, you can get a free map (which will usually indicate parks, although in cities such as Tokyo the smaller parks will not be shown);
  - A method which also works in a lot of cases (especially if you don't have a map of the area) is to find a convenience store (which should not be hard); inside, there are often atlases of the general area you are in…You can take a picture of the page
  - At first urban camping will obviously be a little intimidating, especially in Tokyo, but stick with it and you will learn that it is actually quite easy and even fun once you've done it a few times ! The more you do it, the less you will need to search for parks and the easier it's gonna be. Everywhere you go, you will see potential camping spots, and you will have unlimited freedom in where you want to go.

  - A VERY good book you can buy in Japan is Japan Compact Atlas (コンパクト日本地図帳), it's very very small (perfect for backpacking), contains maps of all Japan, PLUS detailed maps of cities, usually including some public parks. It is an invaluable resource if you plan on traveling a lot (absolutely necessary if you hitchhike). You can find it in many bookstores, it's 1080 yen
   - parking lots of rural temples, Michi-no-eki (road stations), parking lots
  - shower in handicap toilets which have sinks
  - find an onset or sento, usually 400 yen
  - unlimited drinks at internet cafes
  - Due to Japan's extraordinary safety, camping everywhere is very doable and Japan is a very good country to try this lifestyle. Furthermore, camping provides the biggest amount of freedom (you never have to worry about having to find a hotel) and, best of all, it's free!


[from first trip, during my East Asia trip:]
Tokyo:
  - day: see art organizations, contemporary art events
    - research outside the hostel. Go to a cafe or park. somewhere outside!
  - explore Tokyo
    - see wikitravel
      - Ueno's Ameyoko, Yanaka Ginza
      - Shibuya and Harajuku on Sunday to see young fashion
        - Takeshita-Dori
        - Omotesando
        - Yoyogi Park
      - Yurikamome elevated train from Shimbashi station to the bayside Odaiba district
      - Eat a sushi breakfast at the Tsukiji Fish Market.
      - Ghibli Museum from Lawson store
      - Akhibara
  - just keep walking and living outside, as I did in Hong Kong and Seoul, but with a little direction toward art, living with people at the hostel, stay social
  - play arcade games
  - see contemporary art
  - night: contact art organizations, learn Japanese watching Cowboy Bebop, work on games

trip:
Fukuoka? Book ticket to Osaka? Cost of ferry to Osaka?
JR Rail Pass
Hitchhike!?
  - wake up early and go to a station!
  - have paper and marker
Nah, just get a rail pass
  - need to get before going to Japan
Sleep in public parks and railway stations, then take baths at sento and onsen
  - big internet cafes (such as Manboo Cafe or Media Cafe Popeye) there are sometimes showers available
Where to lock bag?
  - large lockers in railway stations, need to check size
  - tourist attractions? probably not overnight.
Hostel prices?
  - $15-25
What's the reason of going to cities? Might as well go fly to Osaka, then bus or slow train to Tokyo. You only have two weeks!
  - would have to either buy a JR Rail Pass for one week for $270 or hitchhike
  - there's a bus from Osaka to Tokyo for $35, but you should try to hitchhike
  - it might be best to develop connections in Tokyo to get a more local experience rather than travelling, especially without a plan, as a lot of time will go into planning
  - I've also just lost interest in travel in Japan. I'd rather just see Tomo and that girl in Osaka, Kyoto, and Tokyo
Eat cheaply: donburi or onigiri

call Panstar to see final price

CouchSurf. Work exchange. Decide if I want to live there. Seek out residential areas. Seek out artists. Check out film studios. Ask studio owners if I can create my own company there. Is the language barrier difficult?

Yukushima

cultural sites:
Historic Monuments of Ancient Nara
Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto (Kyoto, Uji and Otsu Cities)
Historic Villages of Shirakawa-go and Gokayama
