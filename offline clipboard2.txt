daydreams in the morning because it’s so cold to get out of the blanket. It’s more comfortable, to just daydream than to do.

Dream of taking videos on the streets of New York just talking, creating a dialog for myself of figuring out what the school is doing, what New York City is doing to itself, what’s going on. First of a Chinese scavenger, then with a person on the street of put side of the New School talking about what happens to the foreign students, then with another more academic young adult talking about how the current environment of New York became livable by chance, as many chaotic Asian cities aren’t nearly as walkable) Then perhaps with someone else, the last one a dialog with myself going to Babycastles which was bought out to turn into a McDonalds, going to the beautiful, natural anarchic communities of the city, where at th entrance of Silent Barn a kid asks if I’m Kunal, and then gives me a letter to pass on Kunal, the letter written by their admiring /complimenting Kunal of how cool some recent event was.

That’s what I desire: to be in the anarchic communities of the city.

Now, I just need a bit of money to get there. It’s so close.
