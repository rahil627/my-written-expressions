# ideals:
  - have two homes:  a natural one and one in the city
    - the city home exists merely as a place to crash while getting money
      - therefore, there isn’t much need to look for an ideal city apartment, unless it is used as a public place
    - the city home can be replaced by a van
    - **the natural home could be in the mountains where it is less humid and less mosquitos**
      - update from 陽明山: it’s just humid due to constant rain / clouds though feels a bit better than the hot humid of the city, and perhaps just as many or likely more mosquitos, due to being closer to nature; but, perhaps the mountains outside of the northeastern area is better. Even just in the mountains south of Taipei. Or, east of Tainan / Jiayi, or nearly anywhere on the east side.
      - anywhere there is nature (for natural farming), streams (for swimming, bathing, fishing, drinking)
      - the natural home should be either near the city or in the best weather
        - update from 陽明山: the commute to Taipei center is quite a bit distant, wasting automobile energy. or perhaps feels so, because much of the ride is mountain roads and highway, whereas the rural areas have pleasant scenic roads and warm weather, which makes the ride to the city feel better.

# later ideas:
  - make a todo app
  - make a writing app
    - buy and try Voice Dream writer
    - ask writebox creator what happened, or if he wants to continue
      - must use twitter to contact :\
  - make a brainstorm app (to mimic blank paper)
    - support connecting lines to words
      - then using the line-word (or concept, could be image) mapping can display content in different ways
  - and other text-based styling ideas
    - general notes (pending, check, strike-through, etc.)
  - multi-media education website?
    - makes linking parts of media easy (time frame of film, part of game, pages of book, etc.)
  - synthesia-style notation writing tool (and playback), having infinite resolution in time and pitch
# main todo
with iPad
  - add books to Voice Dream
  - lost Voice Dream highlights?
    - check DropBox
    - check file-sharing in iTunes when iPad is connected
Add music to learn, especially piano, but perhaps any?
Make music
- practice piano via Synthesia
- **try making Streamside, Gustaburg, that Forest anime, and a Uyama Hiroto style track.**
Fuck, I need to remember to chill every morning, write, listen to music, think, before doing anything. The need for money made me wake up into stupid routine recently. Well, that and because I must eat at the buffet restaurant twice a day.

Go outside, stay outside at all times. Keep moving. Create all of the time (talk to others or self, write). Do passive things while creating. Be with other people all of the time. Use phone to read. Use phone to blog ideas directly? Reduce belongings in small bag. Need a day life. Never ignore the world, always stay in tune with it, you need the exercise and sunlight. :).
